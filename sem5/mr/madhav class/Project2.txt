---------------------------

Consider an environment with point landmarks, whose locations are known. In this environment give a set of waypoints for the robots to follow. At each waypoint 
perform EKF Localization to localize the robot. Clearly depict

1. The prediction model, with prediction covariance ellipses of robot state. Show how the ellipse area increases as it moves from one landmark to another (Sep 28th) 

2. The measurement and update equations as the robot updates its state and covariance. The corresponding covariance ellipse after the update needs to be shown. 
Do it now as the robot moves from one waypoint to another for each waypoint (Oct 5th)

3. Interface MATLAB routines used for above with C routines for moving the robot and getting measurements to landmarks. Note this is required if you did 1,2 in MATLAB. Show this with an environment simulated in mobile sim/ QT/ OpenCV etc. (Oct 12th)

4. Show it on the robot (Oct 17th)
