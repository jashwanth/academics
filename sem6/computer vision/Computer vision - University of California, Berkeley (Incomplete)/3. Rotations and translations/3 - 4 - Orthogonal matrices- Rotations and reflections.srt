00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,053
Hello again, So in the last lecture we
studied the definition of an Orthogonal

2
00:00:08,053 --> 00:00:16,085
Matrix. And an Orthogonal Matrix is
defined by this condition, a transposed a

3
00:00:16,085 --> 00:00:32,003
= i and a is an Orthogonal Matrix. Or we
can say a is the matrix associated with an

4
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:56,043
Orthogonal Transformation. Right, Why do
we care about this matrices? Let's let the

5
00:00:56,043 --> 00:01:18,063
cat out to the bag, Because Rotations And
reflections Are Orthogonal

6
00:01:18,063 --> 00:01:35,018
Transformations. So, we're gonna set this
up in the second. Let's first consider

7
00:01:35,018 --> 00:01:41,051
the, these Orthogonal Matrices in general
and derive a few of their properties. And

8
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:47,092
from those properties we will see in fact
that Orthogonal Matrices are exactly two

9
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:53,078
kinds. Either they are rotation or they
are reflections. So, let's figure this

10
00:01:53,078 --> 00:02:01,039
out. So, let's, let's take this
relationship a transpose to a = i and

11
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:12,031
derive some consequences. So, one
consequences, some properties. One is that

12
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:23,057
a transpose just a inverse, I showed that
last time. The second property is based on

13
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:32,015
the fact. That it, we will show that the
determinant of a is =,,,, + or - one. How

14
00:02:32,015 --> 00:02:45,087
do we show this proof? Whenever we have
matrices if. C is = ab if a matrix c is

15
00:02:45,087 --> 00:02:56,022
the product of matrices a and b, then
Determinant of c is the product of

16
00:02:56,022 --> 00:03:04,052
determinant of a * the determinant of b,
okay? So, let's apply that relationship

17
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:16,043
here. So therefore Determinant of a
transposed * the determinant of a is going

18
00:03:16,043 --> 00:03:27,045
to be = one. So, we showed that the
determinant of a transposed * the

19
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:36,036
determinant of a = one. Now, we know That
the determinant of the transpose of a

20
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:45,037
matrix is the same as the determinant of
the matrix. So therefore, determinant of a

21
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:56,015
squared is = one. This implies that the
determinant of a is. Equal to plus one or.

22
00:03:56,097 --> 00:04:04,007
To determinant of a is equal to -one. So,
this is a very important property because

23
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:10,065
we have a name for these two kinds of
matrices. And the determinant of a+1 is

24
00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:17,050
equal to the rotation. And when the
determinant of a is -one, we call that a

25
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:26,024
reflection. And you know? Little while
you'll see why we choose these terms. But

26
00:04:26,024 --> 00:04:32,016
for now, just, you just can see that for
any Orthogonal Matrix, it must be the case

27
00:04:32,016 --> 00:04:37,085
that the determinant is +one or -one, we
just give names to these two categories.

28
00:04:37,085 --> 00:04:46,099
We call one of them rotations and the
other one reflections. Okay. Okay, let's

29
00:04:46,099 --> 00:05:01,078
study another property and this is going
to be that the columns of, The columns of

30
00:05:01,078 --> 00:05:17,022
a are orthonormal. Okay, what do I mean by
that? Let's first write out a. So, a is

31
00:05:17,022 --> 00:05:27,033
some matrix and let's say that, let's do
it in two dimensions. So, let's say that

32
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:41,061
this is sum vector a1 and sum vector two,
So, for Two by two, Okay? So far so good.

33
00:05:41,061 --> 00:05:49,080
Now, what do we know about such a matrix?
What is a transpose is going to be. A

34
00:05:49,080 --> 00:06:00,048
transposed is going to be Row vector
corresponding to a1 and row vector

35
00:06:00,048 --> 00:06:15,075
corresponding to a2. And we know. That a
transpose to a = i. But let's calculate

36
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:24,009
what a transpose a is. And let me switch
to a different color. What is a transposed

37
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:30,031
a? A transposed a is going to be this,
let's figure out what those entries are

38
00:06:30,031 --> 00:06:36,062
gonna be. This entry is going to be a1
transposed a1. This entry is going to be

39
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:48,089
a2 transposed a2. And this entry is going
to be a1 transposed. A2 and this will be

40
00:06:48,089 --> 00:07:01,002
a2 transposed a1. Okay? But, the key point
is that this product of a transposed a is

41
00:07:01,002 --> 00:07:13,038
equal to the identity. And this tells me
that therefore A1 transposed to a1 must be

42
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:24,064
equal to one, A1 transposed a2 must be
equal to zero and the same is true for a2

43
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:39,079
transposed a1 and a2 transposed A2 = one.
So, let's repeat what we said, a is equal

44
00:07:39,079 --> 00:08:09,021
to. So, a is a1 and a2, these are column
vectors. And the short That. Okay, but

45
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:16,049
what does that mean? That means that the
columns are orthonormal. By that, I mean

46
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:25,068
what's the length of a1. What's the length
of a1? It's the same as the length of a2

47
00:08:25,068 --> 00:08:36,002
and the, this length is one and that
follows from. That follows from this

48
00:08:36,002 --> 00:08:43,086
property and, And from this observation
that we had. What else do we know? We

49
00:08:43,086 --> 00:08:51,004
know, so therefore, each column is of
length one and. We also know that a1

50
00:08:51,004 --> 00:09:00,017
transpose to a2 is zero. And where did we
see that? We saw that here. So that says

51
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:06,078
that each column is of length one and if I
take the dot product of two of these colu

52
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:12,039
mns, that gives you zero. So it's a very
pretty situation. This means that,

53
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:26,074
essentially. A1 and a2 are Vectors of
length one. Which are mutually

54
00:09:26,074 --> 00:09:42,063
perpendicular? So in other words, you can
use a1 and a2 to make an orthogonal basis.

55
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:48,049
And this is gonna be true in any
dimension. In dimension two, dimension

56
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:54,007
three and so forth. So, in dimension two,
so let's take up the case of dimension

57
00:09:54,007 --> 00:10:06,079
two, In r2. If we have that a1 is a column
vector which is of length one, a1 is

58
00:10:07,034 --> 00:10:17,032
Cosine theta, sine theta. We can pick such
vector without laws [inaudible] of because

59
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:24,043
we know that a1 has to be of length one.
So, we can just call this cosine theta

60
00:10:24,043 --> 00:10:35,084
sine theta, okay? So, what must a2b? Well,
we know that a2 should also be of length

61
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:44,080
one and a2 has to be. The length of a2
should be one and it should be the case

62
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:51,043
that a1 transposed a2 is = zero. So I,
what choice do I have? I essentially have

63
00:10:51,043 --> 00:11:00,020
two choices now. I can make a2. So, that
gives me two choices for a2. Either I

64
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:18,043
could pick minus sign theta cosine theta.
Or. I could pick Sine theta - cosine

65
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:30,083
theta. So, I really have only these two
choices. Because the property of these two

66
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:36,018
choices is that they both have length,
they are of length one that's easy to

67
00:11:36,018 --> 00:11:47,024
identify. But in addition, they are
perpendicular. Okay, but what does this

68
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:56,072
mean? This essentially tells me that the
matrix a, I have only two choices of this

69
00:11:56,072 --> 00:12:06,074
matrix a. This is one choice, cosine theta
sine theta - sine theta cosine theta. This

70
00:12:06,074 --> 00:12:25,092
is one choice Or a is Cosine theta sine
theta, Sine theta Minus cosine theta, This

71
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:32,053
is the other choice. And that is it. The
matrix a has an orthogonal matrix and two

72
00:12:32,053 --> 00:12:37,063
dimensions can be on only these two
points. Okay, let's calculate what the

73
00:12:37,063 --> 00:12:43,028
determinant of this matrix is and what's
the determinant here. If you work it out,

74
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:48,038
cosine theta * sine theta is cosine
squared theta + sine squared theta, the

75
00:12:48,038 --> 00:12:53,090
determinant here is +one. In this case,
what is the determinant? It's minus cosine

76
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:59,042
squared theta - sine squared theta. So,
the determinant here is -one. And recall

77
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:07,000
that I said that for any Orthogonal Matrix
the determinant is either + one or - one.

78
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:20,099
And let's now try to get a physical
picture of this. So, so suppose we have A

79
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:45,029
vector Xy And then consider A * xy, and i
Cosine theta - sine theta sine theta

80
00:13:45,029 --> 00:14:12,028
cosine theta * xy. And this is really
counter clockwise Rotation by theta Which

81
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:18,043
is very nice. And so we have a, a, you can
convince yourself that this is true by

82
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:34,098
starting off with what happens with the
vector one, zero. So, One, zero gets

83
00:14:34,098 --> 00:14:48,079
transformed. And the answer is it gets
transformed to cosine theta, sine theta.

84
00:14:49,072 --> 00:15:01,085
So, if we want to set up a little diagram.
So if we had this initial vector, then

85
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:15,036
after this rotation, it's going to go to.
This angle is theta. And, If we had a

86
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:32,055
vector here, that vector is going to go
to. So, this is counterclockwise Rotation

87
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:45,032
[inaudible] theta. So, in two dimensions,
the story therefore is very simple.

88
00:15:51,053 --> 00:16:10,036
There's two kinds of Two kinds of
Orthogonal Matrices And these are of the

89
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:25,034
type cosine theta - sine theta. Sine
theta, Cosine theta, Or Cosine theta sine

90
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:41,036
theta, Sine theta - cosine theta. These
have Determinant + one determinant - one,

91
00:16:41,036 --> 00:16:55,073
these are rotations, And these are
reflections. Okay, I'm not going to derive

92
00:16:55,073 --> 00:17:14,001
this here but you can verify That the
reflection matrix here Corresponds to

93
00:17:16,005 --> 00:17:39,023
Reflection Around The line With angle
Theta equals That angle theta divided by

94
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:53,092
two. Okay, so now let's go to three
dimensions. In 3D, we'll, Consider the

95
00:17:53,092 --> 00:18:02,054
basic properties of rotations. So, we are
going to have again a matrix with three

96
00:18:02,054 --> 00:18:14,074
column vectors, a1, a2, a3. And, similar
reasoning as in the one [inaudible] Has in

97
00:18:14,074 --> 00:18:33,014
the [inaudible]. The length of each of
these column vectors is going to be. One

98
00:18:33,014 --> 00:18:56,016
and The dot product of any two of them is
zero. So, in other words, a1, a2, a3, they

99
00:18:56,016 --> 00:19:02,078
caused upon to a nice orthogonal basis
rather an orthonormal basis because each

100
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:09,015
of these of unit length. Now in the case
of two dimensions, we could characterize

101
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:14,096
the rotation by just one angle theta. In
three dimensions, it's a bit more

102
00:19:14,096 --> 00:19:21,042
complicated. We need to specify a rotation
in a more complex way and it turns out

103
00:19:21,042 --> 00:19:40,080
that. We need thr ee parameters To specify
a rotation and. Phi a rotation in 3D. So

104
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:46,027
let's see if we can convince ourselves of
that. But, how do we think about this

105
00:19:46,027 --> 00:19:52,076
intuitively and we'll think about it as
algebraic as well. So, intuitively How

106
00:19:52,076 --> 00:20:05,056
will you specify a rotation in 3D. We need
to specify an axis about which the

107
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:15,031
rotation takes place and then we need to
specify an amount of rotation. So, how

108
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:21,064
many degrees of freedom does the axis
have? Since the axis is a unit length

109
00:20:21,064 --> 00:20:27,055
vector, this means that we need two
parameters to specify the axis. The

110
00:20:27,055 --> 00:20:35,036
rotation is some angles, so that's one. So
therefore we need two + one Equals three

111
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:43,072
parameters. So that's one way to think
about it. Let's think about it another way

112
00:20:43,072 --> 00:20:56,037
looking at the matrix From the matrix. How
can I choose a1? How many degrees of

113
00:20:56,037 --> 00:21:03,088
freedom do we have for choosing a1? We can
choose a1 by specifying two parameters.

114
00:21:05,068 --> 00:21:12,004
The reason is that the length of a1 is
constrained; it must be of unit length. So

115
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:17,094
therefore, I can pick a1 with two
parameters. Then, how many parameters do I

116
00:21:17,094 --> 00:21:24,039
have for a2? A2 has to be perpendicular to
a1, okay? So that in fact specifies a

117
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:30,084
plane in which a2 must lie. It has to be
of unit length so I just can choose very

118
00:21:30,084 --> 00:21:38,053
not plane to pick this unit vector so I
will get one parameter. And once I pick a1

119
00:21:38,053 --> 00:21:44,068
and a2, the third, the third vector is
constrained. It has to be perpendicular to

120
00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:50,075
both them so in fact, it's going to lie
along the vector product of this. So, a3,

121
00:21:50,075 --> 00:22:01,014
it adds no new parameters. So if you add
it up, we get three parameters. So this

122
00:22:01,014 --> 00:22:07,054
algebraic way of looking at the columns of
the Orthogonal Matrix and using the fact

123
00:22:07,054 --> 00:22:13,078
that the columns must be orthonormal gives
us the same count that there are three

124
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:19,095
parameters which are needed for specifying
rotation matrix. And I got exactly the

125
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:26,020
same count three when I considered the
fact that any rotation has to be specified

126
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:33,055
by an axis and an amount of rotation. And
the next lecture will continue with how we

127
00:22:33,055 --> 00:22:38,031
can specify rotations in a convenient way
and three dimensions.
