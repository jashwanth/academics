00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,057
Hello. Welcome back. So, in the last
lecture, we started various properties of

2
00:00:05,057 --> 00:00:11,082
Orthogonal Transformations specifically
rotations and three dimensions. So, by now

3
00:00:11,082 --> 00:00:17,097
you must be wondering Is there more. We
have studied rotations, we have studied

4
00:00:17,097 --> 00:00:23,086
translations. Is there more having the set
of Rigid Body Motions, how should we think

5
00:00:23,086 --> 00:00:29,042
about it in general? And here, there is a
theorem and the theorem is that any Rigid

6
00:00:29,042 --> 00:00:34,050
Body Motion can be expressed as an
Orthogonal Transformation followed by a

7
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,051
translation. So, we don't need to consider
anything other than Orthogonal

8
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:45,038
Transformations and translations. A manual
Orthogonal Transformations, there are ones

9
00:00:45,038 --> 00:00:50,048
which have determinant plus one and
determinant minus one and we will be

10
00:00:50,048 --> 00:00:55,038
concerned with deter, those
transformations which are determinant plus

11
00:00:55,038 --> 00:01:00,090
one. And something these are called Proper
Rigid Body Motions and deter, special

12
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:07,000
Orthogonal Group is used. Okay. So, now we
can ask the question, here is a certain

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,030
form of this transformation. Can we say
more about the structure of the set of

14
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:22,040
Rigid Body Transformations, So one
observation here is that the composition

15
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:29,039
of two isometries is an isometry. So, how
do we go about proving this? So there is

16
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:35,062
one isometry given by. The formula here
and let's say another isometry given by

17
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:41,069
this formula. So here, a1 and a2 are the
Orthogonal Matrices. They will correspond

18
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:47,098
to the rotation part if the determinant is
plus one. And then there's a translation

19
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:53,074
given by t1 or t2. So, if we combine this
two, do we get another isometry? Well,

20
00:01:53,074 --> 00:02:00,011
that's really straight forward thing. We
just do the algebra so here let's say we

21
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:06,013
first. We have the point a, we apply psi
two and then we apply psi one so that will

22
00:02:06,013 --> 00:02:12,094
give me this kind of an equation here. And
then if I try to the algebra, I get.

23
00:02:12,094 --> 00:02:21,026
Something else which is a3a + t3 where a3
is a1a2 and the t3 is a1t2 + t1. And this

24
00:02:21,026 --> 00:02:29,028
is again in form of an Orthogonal Matrix
multiplying a vector plus a translation.

25
00:02:29,028 --> 00:02:37,068
So what we see is that composition of two
isometries is therefore an Isometry. Well

26
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:43,068
generally, Isometry is constit ute a group
in the mathematical sense. And again, if

27
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:50,005
you don't know the definition if a group,
you can look it up on Wikipedia. So When

28
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:55,058
you have element of a group and some
operations, we can get new elements of the

29
00:02:55,058 --> 00:03:00,068
group. And, and there has to be an
identity element. So, what will be the

30
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:06,045
identity isometry. It will correspond to
a. Being i, so the Orthogonal Matrix is i

31
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:12,046
which does nothing. And the translation
part should then be just zero and that if

32
00:03:12,046 --> 00:03:18,033
I have an Isometry corresponding to an
Orthogonal Matrix which is the identity

33
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:24,035
and the translation which is zero, I will
have nothing happened as a result of it.

34
00:03:24,035 --> 00:03:29,084
There is an inverse so, if there is a
Isometry specified by the Orthogonal

35
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:35,091
Matrix a and translation vector t, we can
compute what. Should be the Isometry

36
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:41,006
applied to the result of the first
transformation so as to bring us back to

37
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:46,081
the identity and this leave as an exercise
to you. You should be able to work this

38
00:03:46,081 --> 00:03:52,003
out. Isometries are, are the composition
of Isometry is also shared in to that

39
00:03:52,003 --> 00:04:00,061
second, straight forward thing to work
out. Now let's turn to the same form that

40
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:09,020
transformation is matrix multiplication of
the input vector a and then after that

41
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:15,090
there's an addition of a translation
vector t. But now what we do is, we

42
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:22,089
generalize a little bit. What we say is
that a is no longer required to be

43
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:31,062
Orthogonal, a is any nonsingular Matrix in
this case. Meaning that we require that

44
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:37,007
it's determinant be, not be zero but
that's it. So you can see clearly that

45
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:42,086
this is a proper generalization of the set
of isometries or Rigid Body Motions

46
00:04:42,086 --> 00:04:48,080
because Orthogonal Matrices are obviously
nonsingular so everything just works, it's

47
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,059
gonna work out there. But what does this
bias this notion of Affine Transformation?

48
00:04:54,059 --> 00:05:00,038
It's a more general notion, what does it
bias? It buys us more flexibility. So

49
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:07,020
here, I am going to give you an example
where this is the input, this is the input

50
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:13,084
and this, for example, you can think of a
four points of the square is input. Now,

51
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:20,074
there are Orthogonal Transformations we
know about such as rotation, right? That

52
00:05:20,074 --> 00:05:28,040
will do, that will give you something like
this. But Rotations or rotations followed

53
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:35,028
by translations cannot give you effects
such as an isotropic scaling or share. How

54
00:05:35,028 --> 00:05:41,016
are these can be captured by a fine
transformations? So for example, an

55
00:05:41,016 --> 00:05:47,062
isotropic scaling, Let's just think of
what that matrix a must be. For example,

56
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:53,031
it could be something like two, zero,
zero, one. If, with a matrix like that,

57
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:58,075
what will happen is that the x dimension
will get magnified by two, and the y

58
00:05:58,075 --> 00:06:04,034
dimension remains unchanged. So that's an
Isotropic Scaling and this is allowed

59
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:10,029
under the set of Affine Transforms. And we
can have other kinds of matrices a and

60
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:16,053
some of these will give rights to shares.
So and obviously Where, rotations are

61
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:24,089
already included. Okay let's test our
understanding of affine transforms with

62
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:31,065
isometrics by studying how many parameters
are required to specify an isometry versus

63
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:38,009
an affine transform. So, let's think about
isometrics. So, isometry in two dimensions

64
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:43,098
so, in two dimensions, an isometry is a
rotation and how many parameters are

65
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:50,064
required for that one. Any translation for
that you require two so you need three

66
00:06:50,064 --> 00:06:57,001
parameters to specify an isometry or a
Rigid Body Motion in two dimensions. What

67
00:06:57,001 --> 00:07:03,038
about for Affine transforms? So, they're
gonna have two by two matrix so that has

68
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:08,095
four parameters. And then the translation
part which will have two parameters, so

69
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:13,052
therefore, we get a total of six
parameters. Okay now, you may want to

70
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:18,096
think through what will happen in 3D. If
you want pause over there now and try to

71
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:23,078
figure it out before I give you the
answer. So, in 3D, either isometry

72
00:07:23,078 --> 00:07:30,011
[inaudible] in orthogonal matrix followed
by translation, So, the orthogonal matrix

73
00:07:30,011 --> 00:07:35,090
are, is gonna have three independent
parameters. And the translation will be

74
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:44,016
another three parameters For a total of
six. When we consider Affine transforms in

75
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:49,093
3d, what are we gonna get? We're gonna get
a three by three matrix and so the three y

76
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:55,042
three matrix will have nine parameters,
and then there will be translation which

77
00:07:55,042 --> 00:08:00,091
is going to be three parameters so for a
total of twelve. So we see clearly that

78
00:08:00,091 --> 00:08:11,028
Affine Transforms are more general, they
require more parameters to specify. So,

79
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:17,021
the big picture can be understood better
if we try to ask the question, what

80
00:08:17,021 --> 00:08:22,009
remains unchanged under the
transformation. So, mathematically, the

81
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:28,008
term we use is invariance. What are the
invariance in the transformation. So under

82
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:33,036
Euclidean Transformations, we design them
to be such that the preserved length. So

83
00:08:33,036 --> 00:08:38,031
if we have two points, the, the, the
distance between them should be unchanged.

84
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:42,074
That was essentially our definition of
Isometry. So in the Euclidean

85
00:08:42,074 --> 00:08:48,003
Transformations, lengths are preserved,
angles are preserved, as well as area And

86
00:08:48,003 --> 00:08:53,073
volume and so forth. Under Affine
Transforms, we already saw this thing

87
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:59,052
called an Isotropic Scaling case that
lengths are not preserved, angles are not

88
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:04,052
preserved, areas are not preserved.
However, some things are preserved.

89
00:09:04,052 --> 00:09:10,002
Remember these Affine Transforms are
Linear Transformations for the better

90
00:09:10,002 --> 00:09:15,088
translation. And, you can see that if two
lines were parallel to begin with. Then,

91
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:22,079
if we apply a transformation, these two
lines remain lines and they might be moved

92
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:29,028
about, they might be farther apart, but
they'll remain parallel. Parallel lines

93
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:36,011
remain parallel. Another nice property is
that the property of being the midpoint

94
00:09:36,011 --> 00:09:42,093
remains. So, supposed I have points A. And
see and then there is a point b which is

95
00:09:42,093 --> 00:09:49,082
the midpoint of a, b, c and now, we
transform by an affine transform. Will,

96
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:59,060
the line will remain a line. That length
may change. But, let's say the point a

97
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:05,045
transformed to here and the point c is
transformed to here, the point b will

98
00:10:05,045 --> 00:10:12,001
remain the midpoint. So, that is preserved
and again, you can verify all these from

99
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:18,028
the properties that you know. Essentially
the fact that there's a Linear Transform

100
00:10:18,028 --> 00:10:24,032
involved makes all these understandable.
Okay, so, so, here are the big picture. We

101
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:32,023
have the set of affine transforms and
within the set of affine transforms. We

102
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:50,089
have in there the set of Euclidean
transformed. And specifically there's one

103
00:10:50,089 --> 00:11:06,099
particular point. This is t he, The
identity And this corresponds to a=i and

104
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:12,035
the translation part being the zero
vector. So, the identity is included in

105
00:11:12,035 --> 00:11:18,022
Euclidean Transforms and of course, the
identity is included in Affine Transforms.

106
00:11:18,022 --> 00:11:24,001
But the next question we can ask is; now
we got a more general set of transforms

107
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:29,088
and these constitute the group as well.
But all of these as general as we need to

108
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:40,072
be. Okay? Let's think there is a set of
transformations that are called Projective

109
00:11:40,072 --> 00:11:47,002
Transformations but let me first motivate
why we need that. We studied Prospective

110
00:11:47,002 --> 00:11:53,002
Projection, that's after [inaudible]
version motivation here. Under Prospective

111
00:11:53,002 --> 00:11:59,039
Projection, lines on a ground plane which
will parallel. They projected two lines on

112
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:05,024
the image plane that intersected. So
parallelism was not a property that was

113
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:10,058
preserved. And, affine transforms preserve
parallel itself. So, we now know that

114
00:12:10,058 --> 00:12:16,046
Prospective Projection cannot be modeled y
an Affine Transform. And since we want to

115
00:12:16,046 --> 00:12:22,006
play around with Prospective Projection,
we need to consider a more general family

116
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:27,073
of transformations. The answer is provided
by this family of transformations called

117
00:12:27,073 --> 00:12:33,033
Projective Transformations. These are even
more general that Affine Transforms and

118
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:41,058
this include Prospective Projection as a
special case. What are Projective

119
00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:48,054
Transformation? These are Linear
Transformations. Okay, so far so easy. In

120
00:12:48,054 --> 00:12:53,028
fact, you don't need to add the
translation parts separately. The

121
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:59,028
translation can be folded into the Linear
Transformation. But, this used something

122
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:05,022
called Homogeneous Coordinates. Okay, so
now we have another new piece to explain.

123
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:11,074
Homogeneous coordinates, I'm really not
going to get into too much detail on this

124
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:17,002
because this is after of course in
computer vision and not of course on

125
00:13:17,024 --> 00:13:23,054
mathematics. I encourage you to look it up
in Wikipedia. I'll just give you a little

126
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:29,013
taste of what this whole idea is about.
Supposed we have a point in

127
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:36,043
three-dimensional r3. So normally, we
might modulate by, by some three vector,

128
00:13:36,043 --> 00:13:44,002
x, y, z, these are the normal Euclidean
coordinates. What we do is we add another

129
00:13:44,002 --> 00:13:50,088
fo urth coordinate. So, we have now
coordinates x1, x2, x3, x4. But the

130
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:57,048
property is that, any two such vectors are
regarded as the same vector if they are

131
00:13:57,048 --> 00:14:03,092
scaling multiple to each other. So in a
settled sense, the degrees of freedom are

132
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:10,044
still three. So sometimes you can think of
this as, you can go from x1, x2, x3, x4 by

133
00:14:10,044 --> 00:14:16,062
just dividing by the fourth coordinate.
Now, that's, doesn't do anything very

134
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:22,087
exciting unless the fourth coordinate is
zero. And that corresponds to the

135
00:14:22,087 --> 00:14:29,004
so-called point of infinity. In fact,
there are many points of infinity, So

136
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:35,031
homogeneous coordinates enable one to
represent All the things that we have

137
00:14:35,031 --> 00:14:39,086
talked about so far, rotations,
translations, and so forth, all by a

138
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:44,082
single matrix. So in, when we are
concerned with three dimensional space,

139
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:50,062
so, in three dimensional space the normal
points would have three coordinate but

140
00:14:50,062 --> 00:14:56,028
Homogeneous coordinates would make us get
to full vectors and so the matrix, that

141
00:14:56,028 --> 00:15:01,003
would be in more for a Linear
Transformation will be a four by four

142
00:15:01,003 --> 00:15:06,014
matrix. Actually, it will have only
fifteen independent parameters because

143
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:12,015
overall. If, if you might apply all the
entries of this matrix by a non-zero

144
00:15:12,015 --> 00:15:18,025
Scalar, nothing changes because Scalar
multiples correspond to the same point in

145
00:15:18,025 --> 00:15:23,009
projective space. These transformations
are used a lot in computer graphics

146
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:27,092
because in computer graphics when you want
to render objects, you want to rotate

147
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:32,051
them, translate them, project them and all
of these can be captured as Linear

148
00:15:32,051 --> 00:15:36,092
Transformations and Homogeneous
Coordination. So the, there is support for

149
00:15:36,092 --> 00:15:42,007
these kinds of computer available in
graphics hardware. I'm going to stop my

150
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:48,044
coverage of this topic right here because
we'll, we may need to know a little bit

151
00:15:48,044 --> 00:15:54,088
more about Projective Transformations but
we'll develop it as a necessary field that

152
00:15:54,088 --> 00:16:01,080
I don't want the course to become a dry
mathematical review. So I'll just

153
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:07,030
summarize the final story here. We are
concerned with three main families of

154
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:12,008
transformations, Projective
Transformations, Affine Transformations,

155
00:16:12,008 --> 00:16:17,079
and Euclidean Transformations. Euclideans
are the most specific. These are Rigid

156
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:23,008
Body Transformations and they preserve
distances, angles, areas, etc. Affine

157
00:16:23,008 --> 00:16:28,051
Transforms are the more, the next
generalization and Projective is the most

158
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:31,072
general of all. Thank you.
