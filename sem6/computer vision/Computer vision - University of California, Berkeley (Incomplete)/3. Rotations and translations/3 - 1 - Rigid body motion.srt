00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,007
Hi, welcome to the class again. And in
this lecture, we are gonna study Geometric

2
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:09,063
Transformations, the rations and
translations. So, you might be wondering

3
00:00:09,063 --> 00:00:14,090
why we need to have this lesson on Linear
Algebra. The reason we need to have this

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:20,004
lesson in Linear Algebra is because we
want to understand how a camera captures

5
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:24,086
an image of an object in the world and
what happens if the camera moves. So,

6
00:00:24,086 --> 00:00:30,006
that's what we wanna understand. So, there
are two things involved here. So, imagine

7
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:41,086
that we have a camera. And in that camera,
we have a coordinate system. So, in the

8
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:51,010
coordinate system with the camera, we are
going to have x, y, and z. Coordinates

9
00:00:51,010 --> 00:01:06,067
associated with various points in the
object. Right, Now, what happens if this

10
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:23,056
object moves? So, all these coordinates
will change. Coordinates change. Now, is

11
00:01:23,056 --> 00:01:30,008
this, is this really fundamental? Suppose
I have a chair and I moved the chair, is

12
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:36,026
the chair now a different object? In a
setting sense, no, it's the same object

13
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:42,069
but if I measure the coordinates with
respect to the camera, those have changed.

14
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:49,037
So we want to distinguish between these,
these two effects and we use these two

15
00:01:49,037 --> 00:01:57,094
terms in computer version. One is pause
and the other is shape. So, pose refers to

16
00:01:57,094 --> 00:02:11,068
the relationship of the object to the
camera. And it's gonna be characterized by

17
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:18,022
how it is situated with the respect to the
camera. So if I am looking at an object

18
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:24,012
and then I moved that object, then the
pause changes, But the shape doesn't

19
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:30,058
change. The shape is, changes only if I
break that object or tear it apart or some

20
00:02:30,058 --> 00:02:40,018
such thing, is independent Of the
relationship of the object to the camera.

21
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:56,053
So, let me illustrate this with an example
from high school Geometry. So, suppose I

22
00:02:56,053 --> 00:03:05,065
have a triangle. And then I, I can move
it. So, I can move it to some new place

23
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:14,097
and I can rotate it at the same time. So,
what happened is that I have translated

24
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:29,057
each. And I have rotated it. But it's the
same triangle. So, in high school

25
00:03:29,057 --> 00:03:42,021
Geometry, we call this the Notion of
Congruence. So, we'll say that these two

26
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:48,094
triangles Are congruent. And there ar e a
number of conditions under which, by which

27
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:54,040
we can figure out whether the two
triangles are congruent. So, we want to

28
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:00,016
develop this idea more generally. And
basically, what we are gonna come to is

29
00:04:00,016 --> 00:04:05,078
some notion that there's certain
transformations you can do and that does

30
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:23,076
not change the shape. So, shape Of the
triangle Remains unchanged Under The

31
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:54,039
transformation Of rotation and
translation. Note, The coordinate's Xy Of

32
00:04:54,079 --> 00:05:12,035
radius points on the triangle have
changed. So, that's the fundamental

33
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:38,000
distinction Pose Changes When we rotate
and translate the object, Shape Does not.

34
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:46,091
Okay, So, that motivates the study of
rotations and translations. So, let's

35
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:56,013
think about this more generally. So, we
have rotations. And I'm just trying to

36
00:05:56,013 --> 00:06:06,023
rely on your intuition of what rotations
are and translations. And now we will

37
00:06:06,023 --> 00:06:18,018
operate like mathematicians. Are these
Special cases Of more general

38
00:06:18,018 --> 00:06:34,011
transformations? That's the question. And
the answer is yes, And these special class

39
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:48,053
of transformations I call Rigid Body
Transformations. And Rigid Body

40
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:55,031
Transformation include rotations and
translations as special cases. Sometimes

41
00:06:55,031 --> 00:07:10,038
we will use the term Isometry as well.
Okay, what do I mean by Rigid Body

42
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:16,046
Transformation? So let's think of what we
mean by the word rigid body. A rigid body

43
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:22,054
is characterized by the fact that if there
are any points on that rigid body, they

44
00:07:22,054 --> 00:07:29,084
have the same relationship with respect to
each other as the object moves. So, If I

45
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:43,041
have let's say a q. So, I consider this
cube And then I can take some points on

46
00:07:43,041 --> 00:08:00,078
this cube. And if I move this by some
rotation and translation. What will

47
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:11,012
happen? What will happen is that, the
distance is Between any pair of points

48
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:32,013
Will remain unchanged, Right. If you move
the object, the distance between these,

49
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:44,044
The distance between these two points will
remain the same. So this distance Stays

50
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:52,024
Constant. So, we know that this happens
for the rotation and translation. Now,

51
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:58,003
let's think of some objects when this
won't be the case. So, now I will try to

52
00:08:58,003 --> 00:09:05,063
draw a balloon. Okay? And now what happens
to this balloon is that we blow up this

53
00:09:05,063 --> 00:09:13,066
balloon, it becomes much bigger. So if I
have points a and b, Now, these points are

54
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:25,063
much farther apart, a prime and b prime.
So, the distance Between A prime and b

55
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:41,067
prime is unequal to the distance Between A
and b. And in this example of the balloon,

56
00:09:49,067 --> 00:10:06,016
This is Not A Rigid Body Motion. Okay. So,
we have seen some examples, an example of

57
00:10:06,016 --> 00:10:12,000
a Rigid Body Motion and an example which
is not a Rigid Body Motion. So, now let's

58
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,062
get into the math of this and we have
define this formally so now we have the

59
00:10:17,062 --> 00:10:45,044
formal definition. Rigid Body Motion Is a
transformation That preserves Distances.

60
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay, so let's state this more precisely.
Suppose I have point a, this is in three

61
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,009
dimensional space and I have some point b
and this is also in three dimensional

62
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:12,093
space. Now, I apply some transformation
and let's see what is the notation psi for

63
00:11:12,093 --> 00:11:19,041
this transformation. And, this gives me
the new location of the point psi a and

64
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:26,006
the new location of the point b which is
psi b. So, how do I measure the distance

65
00:11:26,006 --> 00:11:37,040
between a and b? So, what is the distance
between a and b. Well, this is given by

66
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:44,074
the length of the vector corresponding to
the difference between the vectors a and

67
00:11:44,074 --> 00:11:56,088
b. So this is just a notation for length.
So, just to remind you, suppose we have a

68
00:11:56,088 --> 00:12:18,075
vector. Vector v which is has three
components, v1, v2, v3 then the norm of v.

69
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:32,024
None of v is given by B1 squared + b2
squared + b3 squared and then you take a

70
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:38,054
square root of this whole thing. So, this
is the notion of length which you studied

71
00:12:38,054 --> 00:12:44,037
in high school and in Linear Algebra
classes. So, what we do here is we, we

72
00:12:44,037 --> 00:12:50,090
take the difference between the vectors a
and b and the we compute the length of the

73
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:57,004
difference and that's the distance between
a and b. Okay. So the, so now let's use

74
00:12:57,004 --> 00:13:04,030
this notation here. So, what's the
distance here. So the distance is going to

75
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:11,090
be the norm of the difference between a
and b and what's the difference here? It's

76
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:18,066
psi of a is the point after, is the point
a after the transformation and psi of b is

77
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:25,001
the point b after the transformation and
we take the l ength of this difference.

78
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:38,099
So, 8f psi is a, So, we can now define
this. If Psi is a Rigid Body

79
00:13:38,099 --> 00:14:00,023
Transformation Then the length of a - b is
equal to the length of psi of a - psi of

80
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:07,066
b. Okay, so that's my definition. So, you
can't really argue with this because this

81
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:15,083
is the definition. Okay, so mathematicians
always start with some definition inspired

82
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:21,038
by, by physical considerations and that's
what we have done here. We want to allow

83
00:14:21,038 --> 00:14:27,013
for the case when an object moves without
breaking apart or stretching or some such.

84
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:32,013
We have been inspired by physical
considerations to define the notion of

85
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:37,013
rigid body transformation but now we are
going to mathematically precise

86
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:43,056
definition. And what we will do now is to
just. Try to follow through on this

87
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:49,016
definition. So, now we'll kind of operate
like mathematicians who use the physical

88
00:14:49,016 --> 00:14:54,062
world as inspiration for some definitions
but then they tried to find examples,

89
00:14:54,062 --> 00:15:00,001
proof theorems and so on and so forth. In
our case, these are going to be about

90
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:04,099
rotations and translations. But first I
have to prove that rotations and

91
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:09,069
translations are Rigid Body
Transformations and this is what I will

92
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:25,000
try to do next. So, let's consider
examples, First is translation, A Rigid

93
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:36,041
Body Motion. That's my question, is it?
Well, let's define what is translation.

94
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:44,032
So, translation is that you just shift an
object by some amount. So the if I have a

95
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:52,054
Point a, after the transformation it's
going to be a + some shift which I'm

96
00:15:52,054 --> 00:15:58,089
indicating by t. Right? So, that's the
definition of translation. So, this is the

97
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:19,012
definition of translation, Okay. Can we
check That this Is a Rigid Body Motion.

98
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:34,097
How do we do this? Okay, so if we have the
point a that's gonna get transformed to a

99
00:16:34,097 --> 00:16:43,045
+ t. If we have the point b, that's going
to get us from 2b + d. Okay. We have some

100
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:50,052
difference here between the point a and b,
so this is the distance, this is the

101
00:16:50,052 --> 00:17:01,087
original distance. And now, let's figure
out the distance between these guys. So,

102
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:20,070
the distance between this guy is going to
be given by A Plus t minus B + t, Correct?

103
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:26,016
And what is this going to be e qual to?
This is going to be equal to the distance

104
00:17:27,075 --> 00:17:34,060
Because the t is canceled out. So this was
the, the old distance was given. So, this

105
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:48,070
is the new distance. Let me indicate here.
And the important point is that. These two

106
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:57,029
distances are the same. Few, that's very
comforting and we have convinced ourselves

107
00:17:57,029 --> 00:18:04,061
that translation is a Rigid Body Motion.
Okay let's take a brake here.
