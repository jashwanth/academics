00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,061
Hello, So, let's continue with the
properties of Orthogonal Transformations

2
00:00:04,061 --> 00:00:09,079
and now what we're gonna do is to study
them by the matrices corresponding to this

3
00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:14,084
transformations. And why do we care? The
reason why we care is that rotation is an

4
00:00:14,084 --> 00:00:19,071
Orthogonal Transformation and we need to
have a really good expertise with, to

5
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:24,074
dealing with rotations and [inaudible]
revision. So, I'm gonna take you through a

6
00:00:24,074 --> 00:00:29,090
mat like chair which is on properties of
rotations. But we're gonna, rotations are

7
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:34,016
special classes of Orthogonal
Transformations. It turns out the two

8
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:42,007
kinds of Orthogonal Transformations.
[inaudible] rotations And the other

9
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:51,024
reflections. But, let's get to this in a
second. What I'm gonna do is, we are gonna

10
00:00:51,024 --> 00:01:07,014
study Orthogonal Transformations Through
the matrices. So, Orthogonal

11
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:13,002
Transformation are Linear Transformations
and therefore they correspond to, matrix

12
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:18,068
multiplication. What we're gonna do is to
study properties of those matrices. So,

13
00:01:18,068 --> 00:01:42,051
supposed we have a point B represented by
a column vector. We have an Orthogonal

14
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:58,034
Transformation psi which corresponds to A
matrix A. So therefore, psi of the point,

15
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:08,074
applied to the point b is really the
matrix a Multiplied with the column at the

16
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:29,007
b. So, we know that this is a Orthogonal
Transformation. And What can we say about

17
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:43,053
its matrix? As an Orthogonal
Transformation, it has some special

18
00:02:43,053 --> 00:02:59,003
properties. What does that imply about the
matrix a? We call The matrix Associated

19
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:22,003
With an Orthogonal Transformation An
Orthogonal matrix. So, in other words, we

20
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:29,069
are gonna start to study properties of
Orthogonal Matrices. Okay, let's do that.

21
00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:52,052
So let's start to use the definition Of an
Orthogonal Transformation. So let's say we

22
00:03:52,052 --> 00:04:04,010
have two vectors, a and b. So, a dot
product with b is the same as psi of a dot

23
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:15,074
product with psi of b, okay? But now, what
is psi of a? This is a * a where a is the,

24
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:34,085
big A is the matrix, Corresponding to the
transformation To psi And, psi of b Is A *

25
00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:46,065
b, okay? So let's capture this. So we want
to show that a dot b is the same as psi of

26
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:59,012
a * dot product with psi of b. So, how's t
hat gonna work out? How do I compute? So

27
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:11,004
what's the dot product in, in matrix with,
with the notation, With matrix notation?

28
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:22,014
So, let's take an example. We want to
compute the dot product of two vectors, a

29
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:28,035
and b. And this is really the same as you
take the transpose of the vector a and

30
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:34,076
then you do a matrix vector multiplication
with b. So, suppose a was a three by one

31
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:40,095
vector and b was a three by one vector,
what is a transpose is going to be? It's

32
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:47,037
the one by three vector and b is going to
be a three by one vector. And when we do

33
00:05:47,037 --> 00:05:53,071
the multiplication and this way we get a
one by one vector which the [inaudible]

34
00:05:53,071 --> 00:06:23,039
number. So, this is a standard way To Get
scalar product. Okay. So let's go back to

35
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:31,025
our condition. The dot product of a and b
must be the same as the dot product of psi

36
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:42,051
a and psi b. This is by definition. Okay?
So, let's rewrite this. This is gonna be a

37
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:53,061
transpose b. Now we are thinking in terms
of vector notation. Vectors and what is

38
00:06:53,061 --> 00:07:09,019
psi of a going to be? This is going to be
a, A dot product with ab. Okay, How do I

39
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:19,056
capture this dot product? What I have to
do is to take the transpose draft on this

40
00:07:19,056 --> 00:07:29,000
case. So, aa transpose ab. And let's
simplify that out, that gives me a

41
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:41,013
transposed a transposed ab. Okay, let's
rewrite this. Therefore, a transpose b = a

42
00:07:41,013 --> 00:08:14,051
transposed. So, this is a relationship
which is true For all choices Of a and b.

43
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:45,080
So, just for simplicity Consider a and b
in r2. So therefore, there are Two by one

44
00:08:45,080 --> 00:09:10,061
column vectors. So we can now consider A
and b to be [inaudible] Unit vectors,

45
00:09:10,061 --> 00:09:42,035
various choices of basis vectors, 01 or
Ten. So, for example We could have Ab 1,0

46
00:09:42,035 --> 00:09:55,098
and 1,0. So, like a unit vector along the
x-axis. And what we know is that a

47
00:09:55,098 --> 00:10:10,044
transpose b is = a transposed, a transpose
ab. Definition of Orthogonal

48
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:28,077
Transformation. Okay. So, but, now we can
take these particular specific examples.

49
00:10:28,077 --> 00:10:45,094
So, if Br, Then what do we get? So a
transpose b will give me one. Okay, That's

50
00:10:45,094 --> 00:10:54,087
what we get on the left hand side. What
happens on the right hand side? On the

51
00:10:54,087 --> 00:11:03,083
right hand side, I have. One, zero
transposed. Then I have this matrix a

52
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:17,092
transposed a. And let's just call this
matrix c11, c12, c21, c22. And what I have

53
00:11:17,092 --> 00:11:28,016
done is, I defined c to be the matrix a
transposed a. And, here I have 1,0. Okay.

54
00:11:28,016 --> 00:11:45,035
So let's simplify this further. This gives
me zero. So, it gives me one Zero, C11,

55
00:11:45,035 --> 00:12:00,024
c12, c21, c22, One, zero. And what is this
going to give me? This essentially selects

56
00:12:00,024 --> 00:12:09,081
out c11. And now, we know that these two
relationships together tell us that c one,

57
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:18,003
one must be equal to one. So, let, let's
just pause a little bit so that we are not

58
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:24,061
totally lost. What I did was, I had a
relationship which I wanted to, I wanted

59
00:12:24,061 --> 00:12:31,050
to study the properties of a transposed a.
And what I did was I picked up particular

60
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:38,010
choice of the vector a and a particular
choice of the vector b. And, from that I

61
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:44,087
showed that this matrix a transposed a,
which I'm calling c, has the property that

62
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:51,005
c11 is = one. And I can now try out
different choices of a and b which will

63
00:12:51,005 --> 00:13:08,034
effectively select different entries in c
And By, By this kind of process We can

64
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:22,048
show That c is the identity matrix one,
one, zero, zero. And this is, of course,

65
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:33,056
the matrix a transposed a. Now this is
really not that surprising because if you

66
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:42,012
recall my basic set up a transposed b was
a transposed * this matrix a transposed

67
00:13:42,012 --> 00:13:50,005
ab. And if that kind of leads one to
expect that this matrix must be the

68
00:13:50,005 --> 00:14:03,048
identity matrix I, where i Is the identity
matrix one, zero, zero, one. So that's

69
00:14:03,048 --> 00:14:23,025
what we have shown. So, So, what we have
shown is that And sometimes, this is used

70
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:34,060
as a definition. This is used as
definition, As the definition of an

71
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:49,078
Orthogonal Matrix. In other words, a
matrix a is said to be Orthogonal if it

72
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:58,074
has the property that a transposed a = i.
Okay, So, let's plug ahead, a transposed a

73
00:14:58,074 --> 00:15:06,034
= i. Actually, you can see a lot from
this. So, I'm gonna just try to derive

74
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:12,094
some conclusions [inaudible]. This just
says that a transpose is equal to the

75
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:18,082
inverse of the matrix a because the
property of an inverse obviously is that a

76
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:24,020
* a inverse should be equal to the
identity and here a transpose will serve

77
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:29,051
as the rule. So, this is very nice. This
means that when we want to find the

78
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:35,010
inverse of an Orthogonal Matrix, all you
do is you just transpose it. The rules

79
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:40,062
become columns and vice versa and now
you've got the inverse, so this is very
