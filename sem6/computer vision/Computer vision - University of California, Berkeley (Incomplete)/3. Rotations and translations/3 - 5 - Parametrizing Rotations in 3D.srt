1
00:00:00,022 --> 00:00:06,072
Okay. Welcome back. So we're going to
study parametrizing rotations in 3D. So

2
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:14,091
let's take some easy cases. How do we
describe a rotation around the x-axis?

3
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:21,033
Well, that's pretty easy because the
x-axis, nothing much happens. So that's

4
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:27,026
where we have this one and then in the yz
we have a 2-by-2 matrix as we would have

5
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:32,063
encountered before. So this is an easy
thing to do. Let's consider rotation about

6
00:00:32,063 --> 00:00:38,081
the z-axis. And this is also easy. Because
in that... As you'll recall that these are

7
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:45,043
the X, Y and Z components. So in the X and
Y plane, we have a standard 2D rotation

8
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:51,064
matrix. In the Z axis nothing much
happens. So that's why we have these

9
00:00:51,064 --> 00:00:56,064
simple rotation matrices. But what do we
do in general? That's the question that

10
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:00,083
we'll study in this lecture. What about
the general case. So there are many

11
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:07,029
different ways of specifying rotations and
three dimensions, and let's consider what

12
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:12,025
they are. First is othogonal
matrices, This is very natural. This

13
00:01:12,025 --> 00:01:19,033
corresponds to the fact that rotation is
linear isometric. But orthogonal matrices

14
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:25,051
are redundant because you, you have a
three by three matrix, so this corresponds

15
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:32,014
to nine parameters. But there are really
only three genuine parameters. So these

16
00:01:32,014 --> 00:01:41,001
nine bit entries in the matrix are
redundant. And we've like to get out the

17
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:45,077
true degrees of freedom of the problem,
which corresponds to axis of rotation and

18
00:01:45,077 --> 00:01:52,016
the amount of rotation. There's some
classic techniques out there. Euler angles

19
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:59,002
is one of them. Quaternions is another
one. This is generalization of the idea of

20
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:04,074
complex numbers, which can be used to
represent rotation in two dimensions. To a

21
00:02:04,074 --> 00:02:09,002
technique that once was representing
rotation in three dimensions. This was

22
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:12,061
quite a big deal when it was when it was
invented in the nineteenth century by

23
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:16,004
Hamilton who was one of the great
mathematicians and physicists of that

24
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:24,058
period. [inaudible] the methodI like those things
in a much more direct way. And what it

25
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:30,053
does is that it tries to give us a way to
go back and forth very simply between

26
00:02:30,053 --> 00:02:35,068
orthogonal matrices and what, what we should think
of as a fundamenta natural

27
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:40,093
representation which is a specified
rotation by giving the axis of rotation

28
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:45,055
and the amount of rotation. Once you have
that you should be able to write down the

29
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:49,072
orthogonal matrix. Conversely given the
orthogonal matrix, we should be able to

30
00:02:49,072 --> 00:02:56,058
write down what facts in a rotation or
amount of rotation. We could do this in

31
00:02:56,058 --> 00:03:03,058
easy case which we saw in the previous
slide. Right? For rotation above the X

32
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:08,023
axis and rotation above the Z axis, you
could do this. But my question for you is,

33
00:03:08,034 --> 00:03:11,004
suppose I have an arbitrary axis. I just
give you some unit vector in, in three,

34
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:18,013
and I give you some amount of rotation.
Can you construct the rotation matrix for

35
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:26,022
me? Conversely I could give you a rotation
matrix and I could tell you okay, tell me

36
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:30,074
what's the axis of rotation? Tell me
what's the amount of rotation? Before we

37
00:03:30,074 --> 00:03:34,088
proceed with the lecture you may want to
stop it right here and try to think about

38
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:39,092
how you might do it, and you may real, you
may then realize that's it's, it, it's a

39
00:03:39,092 --> 00:03:45,005
slightly tricky problem. So we'll, in this
lecture we'll figure out an efficient way

40
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:49,087
to do this. The big idea is that we are
going to represent rotations as

41
00:03:49,087 --> 00:04:12,091
exponentials of Skew Symmetric Matrices.

42
00:04:13,014 --> 00:04:16,006
Okay, so there are some multiples in here,

43
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:21,062
including the term exponential of a
matrix, skew symmetric matrix. But

44
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:25,066
hopefully by the end of this lecture, you
will find that all this is very natural.

45
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:31,025
The skew symetrix matrix is going to turn
out to correspond to the axis of rotation.

46
00:04:31,025 --> 00:04:37,001
So what we're going to do is we're going
to take this axis of rotation. And from

47
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:42,055
that, we will construct a skew symmetric
matrix. We will then construct the

48
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:48,002
exponential of a matrix in some way. And
that exponential is going to give me the

49
00:04:48,002 --> 00:04:52,095
orthogonal matrix. That's the basic story.
And then, how do we go back? Essentially,

50
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:58,011
we, for an exponential, the opposite, the
inverse function is a log. And something

51
00:04:58,011 --> 00:05:07,027
like that will work out here. So let's
start by some review. So you all know the

52
00:05:07,027 --> 00:05:12,040
notion of a vector product or cross product
from physics. So if I'm given two vectors

53
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:19,081
V1 and V2. I've shown them here as vectors
V1 and V2. We can construct the so called

54
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:25,062
vector product or cross product, which is
yet another vector W. And, there are

55
00:05:25,062 --> 00:05:31,017
properties of this vector W. It's going to
be in; we construct the plane of V1 and

56
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:36,054
V2. And then the vector W is going to be
perpendicular to that plane. And its

57
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:42,021
magnitude is related to the magnitudes of
V1 and V2, and the angle between them. So,

58
00:05:42,021 --> 00:05:50,038
the vector W is perpendicular to the plane
spanned by V1 and V2. So you can review

59
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:56,081
this if you have forgotten this
definition. I want to just say as well

60
00:05:56,081 --> 00:06:02,057
that I will use an alternative notation,
instead of just using the cross the x I

61
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:08,061
will use this red wedge symbol. But I use
this for cross product. So, nothing big

62
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:15,002
deal, just a particular notation that, I
like and is used in more higher

63
00:06:15,002 --> 00:06:22,026
mathematical applications. Okay. The next
thing we need to know about skew-symmetric

64
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:30,051
matrices. A skew-symmetric matrix is
defined by the property that, a matrix A

65
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:35,029
is said to be skew-symmetric if A is equal
to minus A transposed. So this is just the

66
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:43,062
definition. But this definition tells us
something, so you have a three by three

67
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:51,027
matrix A then it must have zeros in
the diagonal and if it has entries A, B, C

68
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:56,036
in the off diagonal position here then
entries here minus A, minus B, and

69
00:06:56,046 --> 00:07:11,091
minus C, so it's a three by three matrix but
it has only three parameters. And, what

70
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:17,054
we're going to do is we're going to take
the axis of rotation. Which is a vector in

71
00:07:17,054 --> 00:07:23,038
three dimensional space. And we are gonna
map it to a skew-symmetric matrix. There

72
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,064
is some black magic involved here, which
will become clear later. Let me just

73
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:32,086
remind you that in this course and in this
lecture, you may come across concepts that

74
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:37,076
you are a bit rusty on. You may have
encountered them somewhere in your.

75
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:43,079
Previous linear algebra or physics class
or also calculus [inaudible] and now you

76
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:46,082
may have forgotten them. Well, if you need
to revise them just go look them up in

77
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:52,087
Wikipedia. I find their entries on
mathematical topics to be excellent. Okay.

78
00:07:52,087 --> 00:08:00,050
So now let's build up from this connection
of vector product and skew symmetric

79
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:07,065
matrices. So, this is just the definition
of vector product, which is the standard

80
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:17,005
definition of vector product. I'm given a
vector A. And a vector B And then the

81
00:08:17,005 --> 00:08:22,008
vector product is another vector and this
is what the competence will be. So this

82
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:30,028
you can look up. Here's a new idea. We're
gonna take a vector A. So this is a vector

83
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:44,022
in three. And we're gonna make a matrix A
HAT Which is a three by three matrix. And

84
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:50,010
the way we are gonna do this is that we
are gonna take the entries of A and put

85
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:54,096
them at particular locations in this
matrix. So the vector a has the entries

86
00:08:54,096 --> 00:09:02,075
a1, a2, a3. I take these entries a1, a2,
a3 and I put them in particular locations

87
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:09,031
of this matrix. And now I've got a new
matrix. So is a three-by-three matrix.

88
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:16,028
Okay. This is just some little bit of
juggling around. I'm just Nothing big deal

89
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:23,016
so far. The fun begins here. Given this
matrix, this three by three matrix, an now

90
00:09:23,016 --> 00:09:28,057
I do a vector matrix multiplication. I
multiply a hat and the vector b,

91
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:33,003
which is given by the three components b1,
b2, b3. And you have to just do this

92
00:09:33,003 --> 00:09:38,052
algebra. Take, take this matrix, and take
this vector, and do the matrix, matrix

93
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:49,036
vector multiplication. And you will get.
And you'll get this guy which is the same

94
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:57,069
as this guy So in other words. This matrix
vector product does the same job as

95
00:09:57,069 --> 00:10:03,065
creating the vector product or the, the
cross product that you are familiar with

96
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:10,006
in physics. So we've established a certain
very natural, simple relationship between

97
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:16,077
skew symetric matrices and this process of
creating a vector product or cross

98
00:10:16,077 --> 00:10:21,026
product. Okay what's the value of this?
This is just a little mathematical trick.

99
00:10:21,026 --> 00:10:26,097
The value will come soon. For that I have
to build up another notion which is that

100
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:33,047
of exponentials of matrices. Exponential
of scalars you know, I mean, here's a

101
00:10:33,047 --> 00:10:40,005
classic formula. Each of the x is given by
one + x + x squared upon two victorial +.

102
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:48,011
so on, that's the Taylor series expansion.
Okay. What is the exponential of a matrix?

103
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:56,001
So here A is some matrix. What's the exponential of a matrix? It's, it's kind of

104
00:10:56,001 --> 00:11:01,038
a model equivalent of this formula. But
instead of one, what is one in the space

105
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:06,035
of matrices. Well, multiplying by one
leaves the number unchanged. Multiplying

106
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:14,064
by what matrix leaves matrix unchanged.
It's the identity matrix. Instead of X,

107
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:22,006
well, the objects here are matrices, so
this should be A. And this should be A

108
00:11:22,006 --> 00:11:25,001
squared upon two factor. And what do I
mean by A squared? Well, it's matrix

109
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:32,048
multiplication. Matrix A multiplied by
matrix A, plus the matrix. And so on. So

110
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:39,096
this is a formal is like a Taylor series,
but we can use this to define the

111
00:11:39,096 --> 00:11:46,048
exponential of a matrix and in certain
programming languages such as in Math Lab.

112
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:54,061
You, in fact, have a function called EXPM.
So if you do EXPM of A that says matrix

113
00:11:54,061 --> 00:12:00,076
exponential of A. That will, in fact,
compute into the A. So this is really a

114
00:12:00,076 --> 00:12:05,076
perfectly reasonable object just like the
E to the X that you've known and loved

115
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:16,002
since, the days of high school, really.
Okay. So, why is this idea of matrix

116
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:22,079
exponential useful? Let's do one more
little trick. Let me remind you that

117
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,055
exponentials are arises solutions of
linear diferential equations. So, suppose we have

118
00:12:27,055 --> 00:12:38,072
the equation. X dot equals AX, where X dot
really stands for DX upon DT is X dot X,

119
00:12:38,072 --> 00:12:44,059
just the standard notation. The solution
to this differential equation is that X as

120
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:51,096
a function of time is given by X of zero.
This is just the initial condition times

121
00:12:51,096 --> 00:13:03,011
exponential e To the AT. Again, standard
result This idea applies when we have X's

122
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:10,008
which are vectors. So here, I have this
formula, X dot. But this is now a vector.

123
00:13:10,008 --> 00:13:20,098
And. It's the, the, this is a differential
equation. So what's the solution of this

124
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:28,026
differential equation? So, that the
solution here is going to be, x of t

125
00:13:28,026 --> 00:13:40,012
equals e to the a t, and then there will
be some initial condition x sub 0. So

126
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:46,023
this is the initial condition. And this is
of course a vector and A to the t

127
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:52,072
is of course another vector. But that's my, matrix
exponential. So that's a matrix

128
00:13:52,072 --> 00:14:01,076
exponential. So this is all very nice,
because the notion of, scalar linear

129
00:14:01,076 --> 00:14:06,010
differenti al equations gives rise to an
exponential. Your vector differential

130
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:14,056
equation, and now you get, matrix
exponential. Okay. So now, proceeding

131
00:14:14,056 --> 00:14:20,098
right along I want to remind you of this
equation which you probably encountered in

132
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:43,028
freshman physics. So this Omega here is
the angular velocity vector. So, so we

133
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:56,099
have the position of a point Q and then Q dot
is the time derivative. So Q Is given by

134
00:14:56,099 --> 00:15:10,050
Omega cross product with Q. We can rewrite
this using this new trick that we learned.

135
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:16,022
Which is that, when we want to con-,
construct a vector product, we, we will,

136
00:15:16,022 --> 00:15:25,064
we will make up a new matrix. Make a hat.
And now we will convert it into a, matrix

137
00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:32,019
factor multiplication And the solution to
this differential equation, so now we got

138
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:36,028
a linear differential equation. And the
solution to this differential equation is,

139
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:41,035
as we studied in the last slide, it's
going to be given by the initial condition

140
00:15:41,035 --> 00:15:49,037
Q0 times the matrix exponential e
to the omega hat t. And we can work out

141
00:15:49,037 --> 00:16:00,080
what e to the omega hat t is. It's going
to be given by this Taylor series. Now we

142
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:06,098
actually don't have to Computed in this,
way Which is, to really compute each of

143
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:10,079
these terms and then add them up. There's
much more efficient ways of doing this.

144
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,054
And the reason why there much more
efficient ways of doing this is because

145
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:21,019
these terms omega hat t omega hat t
square omega hat t cubed omega hat t

146
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:25,068
to the fourth power and so on. These are
not all independent After a while. What

147
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:31,072
you, if you work these out, by brute force
calculation, you'll find that they start

148
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:36,084
to repeat. So you can group these terms
together, and so on, and so forth. And,

149
00:16:36,084 --> 00:16:42,080
I'll give you a little flavor of that by
showing how we can calculate the second

150
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:51,046
term in the series, the square term. So
the square term will correspond to

151
00:16:51,046 --> 00:16:56,051
the product of, two skew symmetric
matrices, and I've shown those here. If

152
00:16:56,051 --> 00:17:02,015
you work this out, so suppose we have the
matrix S hat, and then we have S hat

153
00:17:02,015 --> 00:17:05,024
squared, which is the product of these two
matrices. Well, that will turn out to

154
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:13,011
SS transposed minus I. And this is a
straight algebra thing to do. But let's go

155
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:20,009
back to the formula. It turns out that if
we collect these even, odd and even terms,

156
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:25,088
can do a little bit of work along the
lines that I had just illustrated. You can

157
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:31,024
derive a very beautiful formula, and that
beautiful formula is called Rodriguez

158
00:17:31,024 --> 00:17:36,024
formula, and it is given by this
expression. This is really a beautiful

159
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:42,095
formula. Why? Because given an axis of
rotation. And what's the axes of rotation?

160
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:50,080
The axes of rotation here is given by S.
And the axes of rotation here corresponds

161
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,035
to this omega vector, normalized. So I
have taken the omega vector and divided by

162
00:17:56,035 --> 00:18:02,089
its, its magnitude. So I have a unit
length vector S. Given this unit vector S

163
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:08,031
I can make up a matrix, three-by-three,
skew symmetric matrix and put that here.

164
00:18:08,031 --> 00:18:16,008
Okay. What is phi? Phi is the total amount
of rotation and that is given by the

165
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:22,039
angular velocity, omega multiplied by
time. So the angular velocity might

166
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:26,063
be radiance per second, time as in
seconds, so five would be measure in

167
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:33,022
radiance. So if you look at Rodriguez's
formula here, we have S had and S had

168
00:18:33,022 --> 00:18:40,071
squared which are these skew symmetric
matrices that you can construct if you

169
00:18:40,071 --> 00:18:45,047
know the axis of rotation, S. And then we
have five, which is the amount of

170
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:51,019
rotation, which you know. So given these V
have the ability to construct R, which is

171
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:56,096
the total rotation matrix. So if you want
to think about this conceptually, the S

172
00:18:56,096 --> 00:19:04,058
hat, the axis of rotation, in a way, it
specifies. Infinite similar rotation,

173
00:19:04,058 --> 00:19:10,073
what happens in a very, very small amount
of time. Now this process, when you carry

174
00:19:10,073 --> 00:19:15,009
it for a finite amount of time, that's
what gives rise to the finite rotation,

175
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:21,039
which is R. So it's really a
relationship between a rotation when a

176
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,068
finite amount of time has elapsed to the
amount of change when a very, very small

177
00:19:26,068 --> 00:19:32,008
amount of time has elapsed. It's some
intuitive sense. But this relationship

178
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:36,072
here is a mathematically rigorous
relationship. I'm trying to just hand wave

179
00:19:36,072 --> 00:19:44,035
my way to give you an intuition about
this. Okay, now we have achieved our grand

180
00:19:44,035 --> 00:19:50,020
goal, which is, how do we go from notation
matrices to an axis angle representation

181
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:57,009
of [inaudible]. So how do I go from, given
an axis of rotation S, and an amount of

182
00:19:57,009 --> 00:20:04,094
rotation theta to R? Well, from S, we can
construct this S hat. So S is a vector,

183
00:20:04,094 --> 00:20:26,025
and this is the skew symmetric matrix. And
then we can do, just this exponential and

184
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:34,042
that gives me R. Now, this can be
simplified further and that is Rodriquez

185
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:43,088
formula. Okay. So that's how we can go
from an access and a mount [inaudible]

186
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:49,001
rotation to the matrix R. How do we do the
converse problem? I give you a three by

187
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:53,021
three rotation matrix and I want you to
tell me what's the axis of rotation and

188
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:59,067
what's the amount of rotation. Well, you
actually can do the equivalent, the

189
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:04,088
inverse of exponential, which is, log. And
it turns out that in math lab, there is,

190
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:09,021
in fact, a command by which you can take
the log of the R matrix, and that will

191
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:14,050
give you theta S hat. But there are other
ways. Let me show you how we can get the

192
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:19,095
angle theta, the total amount of rotation.
Well, it turns out that the trace of

193
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:25,067
R. And what's the trace of R? It's
the sum of the diagonal entries. This is

194
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:44,058
equal to one plus two cosign theta and you
can verify this from Rodriguez formula. So

195
00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:48,058
since we know what the rotational matrix
are we can compute theta so we know

196
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:53,066
the amount of rotation. What about the
axis of rotation? What can we do? Well,

197
00:21:53,066 --> 00:22:02,001
here is one observation, compute the
eigen vector of R corresponding to

198
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:15,023
eigen value One Because what, what,
what's the property of the access of

199
00:22:15,023 --> 00:22:19,034
rotation? When you apply the rotation, the
points which lie on the access do not

200
00:22:19,034 --> 00:22:24,007
change. So that's why they must correspond
to an eigen vector of eigen value 1. So

201
00:22:24,007 --> 00:22:28,004
that's why we're doing it. But there are a
zillion other ways. You can take Rodriguez

202
00:22:28,004 --> 00:22:37,098
formula and manipulate it around. So, use,
You can use Rodriguez. And you can have R

203
00:22:37,098 --> 00:22:44,048
and the matrix R transposed. And then from
these, you can kind of pull out S hat. And

204
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:49,041
once we have the S hat matrix, you can
easily read out the, the axis of rot

205
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:56,007
ation. So we have, thus, achieved our
grand goal which is to be able to go back

206
00:22:56,007 --> 00:23:00,058
and forth between rotation matrices, which
are orthogonal matrices, three-by-three

207
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:08,011
matrices, to an axis of rotation
representation. Now we can choose

208
00:23:08,011 --> 99:59:59,000
whichever one makes more sense for our
purposes.
