00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,065
Hello, So, let's continue with our lecture
on Rigid Body Motions. So, in the last

2
00:00:06,065 --> 00:00:13,047
lecture we studied the definition of Rigid
Body Motions which is that if I have

3
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:20,054
points a and b then, the length before the
transformation is the same as the length

4
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:35,039
after the transformation, That's the
definition. And then we did an example,

5
00:00:36,089 --> 00:00:45,056
And the example was translation. And
translation is defined as point a gets

6
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:53,005
mapped to the point a + t and you can
think of t as the shift. Okay, in today's

7
00:00:53,005 --> 00:01:05,094
lecture we'll focus on rotations. And what
I'm gonna do is to try to formally define

8
00:01:05,094 --> 00:01:11,042
rotations and just give you the
mathematical and openings of working

9
00:01:11,042 --> 00:01:17,061
comfortably with rotations. So rotations
of two main properties, they are, first

10
00:01:17,061 --> 00:01:34,095
they are Linear Transformations. What do I
mean by Linear Transformations? So Linear

11
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:45,058
Transformation, if we have points supposed
a gets mapped to psi of a And b gets

12
00:01:45,058 --> 00:01:57,047
mapped to psi of b. Then if I have the
point alpha a + beta b that should be

13
00:01:57,047 --> 00:02:14,042
mapped to alpha psi of a + beta * psi of
b, This is the definition Of a Linear

14
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:19,084
Transformation. Okay, that's one way to
think about it abstractly in a

15
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:25,086
mathematical sense. But there is a more
practical way to think about it which is

16
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:42,081
that, suppose a is a vector. Another way
Is that psi of a is given by a matrix

17
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:55,050
times a vector a. So here, let's get our
notation right. This is a matrix. And this

18
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:05,068
is a vector. Okay, let's take up another,
let's state this more clearly. So, so

19
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:32,043
suppose we have a We have points in r2,
Then a is A vector Eg, A1, a2, And any

20
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:58,083
Linear Transformation Corresponds to a
matrix multiplication. So let me indicate

21
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:12,053
this by psi of a is going to be some
matrix. Let's use b11, b12, b21, b22.

22
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:20,078
Multiplying this vector a. So in other
words, the vector a by, if we will

23
00:04:20,078 --> 00:04:27,093
multiply by some matrix b * this vector a,
we get the result of this Linear

24
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:35,086
Transformation. And what we can show is
any Linear Transformation can be expressed

25
00:04:35,086 --> 00:04:43,050
by such a matrix multiplication. So, we
can think equivalently in, in this matrix

26
00:04:43,050 --> 00:05:01,027
notation. So I, I'd like to have my points
Are going to be column v ectors. And so if

27
00:05:01,027 --> 00:05:16,010
we have transformations, Linear
Transformations From two dimensional space

28
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:39,042
to two dimensional space are represented
by Two by two matrices Has Here And if we

29
00:05:39,042 --> 00:06:02,073
are in three-dimensional-space. Then A
point is Of type B1, b2, b3. So, it's a

30
00:06:02,073 --> 00:06:26,030
column vector And any Linear
Transformation From R3 to r3 Corresponds

31
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:46,094
to Multiplication by Three by three
matrixes. So we might have a matrix A11,

32
00:06:46,094 --> 00:07:05,091
a12, a21, a21, a22, a23, a31, a32, a33 and
then. We have b1, b2, b3. And this gives

33
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:15,000
me some new column vector. Let's use the
notation c for this, c1, c2, c3. So, this

34
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:29,051
corresponds to c is the product of Matrix
Multiplication. In this way and. Is the

35
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:49,080
matrix, a here is the matrix corresponding
to the Linear Transformation. Okay. So,

36
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,062
this is just standard a Linear Algebra.
Any Linear Transformation can be expressed

37
00:07:55,062 --> 00:08:01,007
by a matrix and matrix is obviously a
Linear Transformation. So, let's go back

38
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:22,023
to Rigid Body Motions. So, we want to
understand Rigid Body Motions That are

39
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:45,040
also Linear Transformations. Okay, how do
we do that? So I mean I so we, we, we need

40
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:52,053
to somehow study the condition of Rigid
Body Motion and add that condition to that

41
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:59,013
of being a Linear Transformation. So,
we're gonna add a little definition here

42
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:32,075
And Orthogonal Transformation Is a Linear
Transformation That preserves In a

43
00:09:32,075 --> 00:09:45,003
product. So, that's the definition of
Orthogonal Transformation. So suppose that

44
00:09:45,003 --> 00:09:55,055
we have, we have a and we have b. And a
gets mapped to psi a and b gets mapped to

45
00:09:55,055 --> 00:10:04,014
psi b. What do I mean by inner product?
So, the inner product before the

46
00:10:04,014 --> 00:10:10,000
transformation is given by a dot product
with b, and the inner product after the

47
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,037
transformation is given by psi of a dot
product with psi of b. And these two are

48
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:29,013
equal. And for those of you who have
forgotten what I mean by inner product A

49
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:53,039
dot b Is also called Scalar Product. So,
if a is a1a2 and b is b1b2 and I express

50
00:10:53,039 --> 00:11:07,065
them as column vectors that ab = a1b1 +
a2b2. Okay. So, this is the definition.

51
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:13,025
So, essentially what I'm saying is in a
product preserved, any transformations

52
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:19,007
which have this property, any Lin ear
Transformation which have this property is

53
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:24,089
called an Orthogonal Transformation. So
let's try to understand this some

54
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:48,041
properties of Orthogonal Transformations.
So, one property is that Orthogonal

55
00:11:48,041 --> 00:12:10,073
Transformations preserve norms. So if I
had point a. Okay. So, what do I know? If

56
00:12:10,073 --> 00:12:19,019
I have a, that gets transformed to psi of
a. And let's consider now again the point

57
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:25,063
a, and that gets transformed to psi of a.
Now consider the dot product before the

58
00:12:25,063 --> 00:12:36,009
transformation, that is going to be a dot
a. So this is before. And now let's

59
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:44,001
consider the dot product after the
transformation, psi of a dot psi of a. And

60
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:51,061
this is the dot product after the
transformation. Okay. And by the property

61
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:57,005
that this Orthogonal Transformation
preserves norms, what do we know? These

62
00:12:57,005 --> 00:13:08,009
two must be equal. Okay, Then, let's write
the south. This means that norm of a

63
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:21,026
squared = the norm of psi of a. Squared.
So clearly, the norm has been preserved.

64
00:13:21,026 --> 00:13:39,091
In other words, length is being preserved.
So, this might lead you to think that

65
00:13:39,091 --> 00:13:45,048
Orthogonal Transformations are consistent
with the concept of Rigid Body

66
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:51,088
Transformations. But let's prove this more
generally. So, what we have to do now is

67
00:13:51,088 --> 00:14:05,032
to show this. So, more generally We're
gonna have some point a and this point is

68
00:14:05,032 --> 00:14:11,033
gonna get transformed to psi of a. We're
gonna have a point b, and that's gonna be

69
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:28,066
transformed to psi of b. And what do we
need to show? We need to show That is

70
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:59,050
equal to If Psi is a, Is an Orthogonal
Transformation. So that's something to be

71
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:20,021
proved. So how do we prove this? So, let's
do the following. Let's consider. The

72
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:37,001
length of psi a - psi b, and what is that
going to be? So this is going to be. So,

73
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:45,026
that's the length of psi a and psi b. And
the question is, is this equal to the

74
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:55,047
length of. So we don't know whether this
is true but that's what we'll try to

75
00:15:55,047 --> 00:16:00,002
prove. If we can manage to show that the
two of these are equal, we are in

76
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:05,031
business. So we can expand this out so I'm
putting a question mark here to imply that

77
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:11,069
we don't know whether this is true or not.
So what do we get? If we. Expand this out,

78
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:31,065
we are going to get. So, that's what we
get in the left-hand side and the question

79
00:16:31,065 --> 00:16:46,066
is, is this equal to. What we get on the
right-hand side. Okay. Now, let's make

80
00:16:46,066 --> 00:17:06,003
some observations which we'll do on the
side. So, we have earlier showed that. And

81
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:20,084
we are sure that. Okay, we showed this in
the previous page. So, that's good. So,

82
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:37,073
and what else do we know? We know that.
Psi of a dot psi of b is = a dot b. So,

83
00:17:37,073 --> 00:17:48,097
these are all true. And one of this is
true by definition and these were proved

84
00:17:48,097 --> 00:18:00,011
and these do approved Previously. Okay,
So, now we are in business. We are trying

85
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:10,023
to ask the question Is this expression
equal to this expression? Okay, but we

86
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:16,043
have and we can use some properties here.
So we just showed that psi of a squared is

87
00:18:16,043 --> 00:18:22,003
= a squared. So the length of psi of a is
the same as the length of a. So this

88
00:18:22,003 --> 00:18:28,047
enables us to cancel this guy, these two
guys are the same. The length of b after

89
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:34,063
the transformation is the same as the
length of b before the transformation. So,

90
00:18:34,063 --> 00:18:41,018
therefore this and this are the same. And
we also showed that psi a dot product with

91
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:47,073
psi b is the same as a dot product with b.
And therefore, this term and this term are

92
00:18:47,073 --> 00:18:57,031
the same And this is great. Excellent, So,
we are very happy because we have shown

93
00:18:57,031 --> 00:19:13,042
that these are, these two are. Equal. So,
in other words we have proven This result.

94
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:34,079
Okay, but what does this mean? What this
means is that. Therefore, psi is a Rigid

95
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:51,064
Body Motion. So, let me summarize the
result. So, the result is that An

96
00:19:51,064 --> 00:20:16,075
Orthogonal Transformation Is A Rigid Body
Transformation. So just to remind you, we

97
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:35,069
started with the definition of Orthogonal.
Was that it is linear And it preserves

98
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:58,063
inner products. Okay, So, in other words A
dot b = psi of a dot psi of b. And the

99
00:20:58,063 --> 00:21:20,006
definition of Rigid Body Transformation
Was that The length of a - b is the same

100
00:21:20,006 --> 00:21:38,053
as the length of psi a - psi of b. And,
what did we proved? We proved That

101
00:21:38,053 --> 00:22:01,057
Orthogonal Transformations are rigid, Have
Rigid Body Transformations. Okay, And, and

102
00:22:01,057 --> 00:22:19,070
recall that earlier we proved That
translations Are Rigid Body

103
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:32,070
Transformations. So there' s, we have two
examples of this.
