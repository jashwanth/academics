1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,006
Welcome back. We're ready to resume study
of Geometry of Stereopsis and now we are

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:11,070
ready to tackle the general case. So, the
general case, we don't know how the two

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:17,048
cameras are arranged in space and we still
have to figure out what the depths of

4
00:00:17,048 --> 00:00:23,033
points are. And this happens often enough,
like very common scenario is we download

5
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:33,072
images from the Internet. So for example
these could be many people taking

6
00:00:33,072 --> 00:00:39,025
photographs of Eiffel Tower or any
landmark that you might like and what we

7
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:44,077
want to do is to generate a 3D model of
the Eiffel tower from this multiple

8
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:49,049
photographs so. In this case, we do not
know how these photo, where these

9
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:54,074
photographs were taken from. There is some
unknown Euclidean transformation which

10
00:00:54,074 --> 00:01:00,012
relates these cameras, we don't know that.
What we should be able to do otherwise to

11
00:01:00,012 --> 00:01:05,050
solve for point correspondences among the
images and somehow figure out everything.

12
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:10,029
Figure out how those two cameras are
arranged in space as well as what the

13
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:15,051
depths of points are. Of course, the
general problem requires multiple cameras,

14
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:20,095
not just two. I mean, you have thousands
of tourists taking pictures of the same

15
00:01:20,095 --> 00:01:26,074
object in, in, in some tourist spot. But
we'll currently study the case for two

16
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:32,048
cameras and the general cases fairly
straight forward. So let's go to it and.

17
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:40,022
What we have to understand here is the
notion of Epipolar Geometry. So, this is a

18
00:01:40,022 --> 00:01:46,056
multiple but I'll try to take you this
notion in a series of slides. So, I have

19
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:53,006
this basic diagram that I want you to try
to understand and get a good physical

20
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:59,032
inclusion for. So, we have some point
amendable and it is imaged in two cameras.

21
00:01:59,032 --> 00:02:05,090
The two cameras have camera center c1 for
the first camera and c2 for the second

22
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:11,067
camera. I could say first the camera, the
second camera or I could say left camera

23
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:16,086
and right camera. Pretty soon that left
and right camera will seems to be

24
00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:22,076
meaningful because it could be the left
camera just above the right camera and so

25
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:28,010
on but let's say that this notation for
now. I want you to get a sense of a

26
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:33,093
physical picture here. So C1 here is the
pin hole an d then we have the image plate

27
00:02:33,093 --> 00:02:41,014
and where is the image plate? The image
plate is f units Behind c1. So, c1 is in

28
00:02:41,014 --> 00:02:47,088
front of the image plane. So, please don't
make the mistake of assuming that c1 lies

29
00:02:47,088 --> 00:02:54,055
in the image plane. C1 does not lie in the
image plane, c1 is the pinhole, c1 is the

30
00:02:54,055 --> 00:03:05,074
center of projection. C1 is in front of
the left camera. Similarly, c2 is in front

31
00:03:05,074 --> 00:03:13,029
of the right camera. It's in, it's in
front by distances of f. It's not lying on

32
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:20,057
the image plane of the camera. Okay. So
now this diagram illustrates how image

33
00:03:20,057 --> 00:03:27,003
projection happens so we have M which is
the point in the world. C1 does inter

34
00:03:27,003 --> 00:03:34,017
projection so we can draw the line between
M and C1 The real Going through C1 from M

35
00:03:34,017 --> 00:03:41,013
and that way intersects the image plane
from camera one at some point and let's

36
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:48,044
call that point M1. Similarly the ray from
M through C2 intersects camera two at the

37
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:55,035
point ends at two so ends at two is the
projection. So M1 and M2 do lie on the

38
00:03:55,035 --> 00:04:03,014
image planes of the respective cameras but
C1 and C2 are in fact by distance of F, So

39
00:04:03,014 --> 00:04:09,093
far so good. What I'm gonna take you
through is the definition of Epipolar

40
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:17,031
plane. Okay. It's a fairly straight
forward definition bit it will give us a

41
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:24,013
lot of image so it's what's understanding
[inaudible] detail. If there's a point m

42
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:30,054
in the world, consider the plane formed by
m, c1 and c2. So, it's a point in the

43
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:36,069
world and the two cameras, center of
projection, m, c1, c2. So, this is a plane

44
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:43,059
and here it is shown by this, this dash
lines and this [inaudible] plane, we call

45
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:52,088
the Epipolar plane. Okay. Note that we can
describe it as MC1C2 but I could also

46
00:04:52,088 --> 00:05:01,051
describe it as MM1, the projection of, of
the point M in camera one or And then n2

47
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:07,062
which is the projection of MA camera two.
So if I consider m, m1, m2, that is the

48
00:05:07,062 --> 00:05:13,073
same plane. In fact, this is gonna be
important because we are eventually going

49
00:05:13,073 --> 00:05:19,044
to make observations just from images.
Those tourists have uploaded those

50
00:05:19,044 --> 00:05:26,002
photographs and now we have only access to
those photographs. So, that's the concept

51
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:32,052
of Epipolar plane. Now there can be many
Epipolar planes because we can have

52
00:05:32,052 --> 00:05:39,042
different points and we could choose the
point on a new point m which does not lies

53
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:46,041
on this Epipolar plane in which case we'll
get a new Epipolar plane. Sometimes people

54
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:53,042
use Book of Epipolar Planes because why,
why is it a book? Well consider, think of

55
00:05:53,042 --> 00:06:00,037
c1, c2 as being the spine of this book and
the entire fact, all the Epipolar Planes.

56
00:06:00,037 --> 00:06:07,049
Go through the lines C1, C2 but it's like
a book where there is spine of the book,

57
00:06:07,049 --> 00:06:14,062
the spine of the book would be C1, C2 and
then we have all the sheets of the book.

58
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:22,051
Okay so we now understand the notion of
Epipolar plane. The next important idea is

59
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:30,072
of Epipolar line. Epipolar lines are the
intersections of the Epipolar plane with

60
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:38,014
the image planes. So we have our Epipolar
plane, Mc1, c2. It will intersect the

61
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:45,031
image plane of the left camera on some
line. Okay. So that line is shown here in

62
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:51,088
red and we call that an Epipolar line on
the left camera or on the first camera

63
00:06:51,088 --> 00:06:58,061
depending on what you like. And then, the
same plane, Mc1, c2 intersects the image

64
00:06:58,061 --> 00:07:04,086
plane of the right camera on some other
line and that shown here and that's.

65
00:07:04,086 --> 00:07:11,085
Called the Epipolar line in the second
camera so we have one Epipolar plane in

66
00:07:11,085 --> 00:07:18,094
C1, C2 and it gives rise to two Epipolar
lines One in the left camera, one in the

67
00:07:18,094 --> 00:07:27,030
right camera. Okay. So now I have explicit
mark these so we have the Epipolar line in

68
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:33,093
the left camera, the Epipolar line in the
right camera. The big observation here is

69
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:39,084
that the projection of M in the post
camera which I will call M1 and the

70
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:46,004
projection o M in the second camera which
is M2. M1 and m2 lay on corresponding

71
00:07:46,004 --> 00:07:52,008
Epipolar lines. So, this Epipolar lines
come in pairs because once that we defined

72
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:57,067
that Epipolar plane, we get the two
Epipolar lines which corresponds to the

73
00:07:57,067 --> 00:08:03,093
intersection with the two image planes And
the projection of this, all the points in

74
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:09,098
this Epipolar plane and then many of them.
It's not just the point m but any point

75
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:15,095
which lies on this Epipolar plane is going
to project to the. In the left camera to

76
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:21,033
the corresponding Epipolar line and in the
right camera to the other c orresponding

77
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:26,026
Epipolar, Epipolar line, So, note that
there are some situations in which this

78
00:08:26,026 --> 00:08:31,006
Geometry is very simple. So, suppose the
two cameras are arranged with their

79
00:08:31,006 --> 00:08:36,006
optical axis parallel to each other, we
started this case; this corresponds to

80
00:08:36,006 --> 00:08:42,049
looking at infinity. It parallel optical
axis. In this case, Epipolar, The Epipolar

81
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:47,041
Geometry is particularly simple. All the
Epipolar lines are horizontal lines so

82
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:52,065
that's a very simple case. But the theory
I have described in the last few slides is

83
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:57,095
the general theory and this applies to any
two cameras. They are not required to have

84
00:08:57,095 --> 00:09:02,094
intersecting optical axis or parallel
optical axis or whatever. This will always

85
00:09:02,094 --> 00:09:07,087
be true for any two cameras because two
cameras will have optical center c1, c2,

86
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:12,061
pick a point out in the wall called M.
Mc1, c2 defines the Epipolar plane, the

87
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:20,032
intersection is defined the Epipolar
lines. There is one other term I want you

88
00:09:20,032 --> 00:09:29,025
to keep in mind. This is the so called
Epipol. Epipol is, there is an Epipol in

89
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:38,045
each, in each camera and Epipol is the
projection of the Pinhole of the other

90
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:45,089
camera. So, what is Epipolar e1? E1 is,
let's state a point c2 which is the center

91
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:53,051
of projection of the second camera and
let's figure out where c2 projects in the

92
00:09:53,051 --> 00:10:00,048
camera and that is call the e1. So,
essentially, we consider the ray from c2

93
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:07,051
to c1 and then we extend that. And then,
it will intersect the image plane and that

94
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:14,005
point is e sub one and that's called the
Epipolar in the left camera. That's just

95
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:19,087
the terminology and the double b, that
take that same line c1, c2 and now

96
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:26,030
projected to intersect. The second image
plane, the right camera's image plane and

97
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:32,083
there that intersection point we will call
e sub two and that's the Epipole in the

98
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:39,005
right camera. Okay, so now we have added
one more term to our vocabulary. We have

99
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:45,039
Epipolar plane, Epipolar lines and
Epipoles. Okay so why are we doing all

100
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:50,077
these? We're doing all these because we
want to deal with the case of images taken

101
00:10:50,077 --> 00:10:55,061
back to cameras which are with some
unknown position with respect to each

102
00:10:55,061 --> 00:11:00,033
other. By unknown positi on I mean there
could be some rotation which and

103
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:05,057
translation which relates the camera to
its coordinate frame to that of camera

104
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:10,055
one. And we don't know it, it's some
unknown odd and some unknown [inaudible]

105
00:11:10,055 --> 00:11:16,045
and what we have access to other images
are each of these cameras. So that's going

106
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:23,076
to be the, the general version of the
synopsis problem. We have given. Some n

107
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:30,026
image points in the left camera and in the
right camera. And we do not know the

108
00:11:30,026 --> 00:11:35,079
relationship between the coordinate frames
of the two cameras. So, we were given end

109
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:40,092
points correspondences. We do know that,
that for this end points, we know what

110
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:46,031
that partners are. We know that there is a
point a in the left image and this end

111
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:51,058
point a prime in the right image, they
both correspond to the same point out in

112
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:56,077
the world. So, we have given these end
point correspondences and our goal is to

113
00:11:56,077 --> 00:12:03,019
estimate the rotation and translation
which derives the cameras And the depths

114
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:10,096
of the n points so we'll take that up
later. Thank you.
