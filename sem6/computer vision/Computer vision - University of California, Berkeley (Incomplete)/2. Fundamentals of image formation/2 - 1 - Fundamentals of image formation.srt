00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,017
Okay. Hello? Welcome to the class again.
So this lecture is going to be about the

2
00:00:06,017 --> 00:00:13,008
fundamentals of image formation. So, any
camera creates an image. The image eye of

3
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:18,051
XY is a measure of how much light is
captured the pixel XY. We are interested

4
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:23,080
in two questions. First, where is the
point XYZ in the [inaudible] image and

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,030
what is the brightness of the resulting
point XY? So, in this lecture, we'll try

6
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:34,086
to get a handle on the first question
which is where does the point XYZ in the

7
00:00:34,086 --> 00:00:40,095
[inaudible] image? So this is the
so-called pin hold camera model. The

8
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:48,038
ignore lenses and such for the time being.
Imagine that all the light in the imaging

9
00:00:48,038 --> 00:00:55,038
surface which is at the back here comes
through the pin hole of the camera and

10
00:00:55,038 --> 00:01:02,073
this object therefore we see this point b.
Is imaged to the point [inaudible]. And

11
00:01:02,097 --> 00:01:09,008
let's take note of the coordinate systems
here. The coordinate system here is

12
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:15,075
located at the pinhole of the camera and
we have the X, Y and Z axis in the vault.

13
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:27,087
The Z axis is what's called optical axis
of the camera. And then we have the x and

14
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:34,062
y axis. Notice that in computer version we
very often follow this coordinate system

15
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:40,048
where y is up and z is away from the
camera. This is a distinct from the

16
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:47,023
notation usually used in physics where z
is in the direction of the gravity vector.

17
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:52,067
Okay. Let's stay with this notation. We
also have a quadrant system on the image

18
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:58,087
plane and that is indicated here by little
x and little y So that little x and little

19
00:01:58,087 --> 00:02:04,045
y notation correspondents to the
coordinates on the image grain of the

20
00:02:04,045 --> 00:02:10,050
camera. So, our goal is going to be to
figure out the relationship between the

21
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,069
coordinates to the point b in the
3-dimensional vault and the, its

22
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:21,082
coordinates in the projection. And the
basic equation is given by little x - fx

23
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:32,077
[inaudible] z and little y - fy
[inaudible] z. So. Okay. So, let's derive

24
00:02:32,077 --> 00:02:41,094
this equation. How do we do that? So we're
gonna proof a special case first and this

25
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:47,038
is about the special case of a point b in
the y z plane. So let's go back to the

26
00:02:47,038 --> 00:02:52,089
events you can remember what's going on
here. We're going to consider the point b

27
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:58,020
but we consider a special case when it
lies in the y z plane. We're gonna draw

28
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:03,071
the optical access and we're also going to
show the projection of b in the image

29
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:15,056
plane. So that's p and this here is the
projection of p, little p. And what are

30
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:27,017
these distances? This distance, This
distance here is going to be z. This

31
00:03:27,017 --> 00:03:37,052
distance here is going to be F. This
height here is going to be given by upper

32
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:48,068
case Y. And this Height here is going to
be given by y, little y but actually it's

33
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:55,079
going to be minus y because the coordinate
system, in the coordinate system the y

34
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:03,012
axis points upwards. Let's go back so you
can see that I've drawn this correctly. So

35
00:04:03,012 --> 00:04:11,042
if you look at the slide it becomes clear
what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to draw

36
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:19,013
the coordinates but since the y axis
points up, distance going down should be

37
00:04:19,013 --> 00:04:26,043
marked as -y, okay. So we are back to
this, back to this equation and now we

38
00:04:26,043 --> 00:04:42,019
have a fairly easy job. We use similar
triangles. The two triangles here are

39
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:57,011
similar to each other so therefore what we
can say is f / -y = z / Y and this implies

40
00:04:57,011 --> 00:05:18,043
that. Y = -f. It's y divided by z. Okay.
Now this was for the special case when the

41
00:05:18,043 --> 00:05:28,085
point P lies in the YZ plane. But really
this is true Even if the point is, Even if

42
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:47,008
the point P Is not in the y z plane. And
the way you can convince yourself of that

43
00:05:47,008 --> 00:05:52,076
is that all we have to do is to consider
the projection of b on the y z plane and

44
00:05:52,076 --> 00:05:58,037
then the relationship with the two. So we
have derived this, this equation for the

45
00:05:58,037 --> 00:06:10,054
projection of the y coordinate and by
similar reasoning. We can expect that we

46
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:25,008
will get a relations that is off the type
x = minus F x upon z. So this just states

47
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:32,003
this and now I've written out this
equation in sort of nice mathematical

48
00:06:32,003 --> 00:06:39,075
notation. So notice a few things here so
there are some conventions here which is

49
00:06:39,075 --> 00:06:47,094
that the lower case quantities are used to
correspond to variables of the image plane

50
00:06:47,094 --> 00:06:55,061
and upper case variables are used for.
Four points which are in the scene, in the

51
00:06:55,061 --> 00:07:02,008
three dimensional scene, So if you notice,
look at this equation. There's one

52
00:07:02,008 --> 00:07:09,023
annoying property of this equation which
is that there are these minus signs The x

53
00:07:09,023 --> 00:07:15,087
- FX upon Z, y - FY upon Z. Now what these
minus signs correspond to is that the

54
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:22,093
image is inverted. The image is inverted
both upside down as well as left to right.

55
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:30,025
And this is something you can find
annoying but this is actually true of

56
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:37,072
projection of images even in the retina
and in fact the diagram that I have is

57
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:44,020
from the cuts [inaudible]. So, we do this.
The image is in fact actually inverted.

58
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:50,034
So, this caused many people a lot of
consternation back at once upon a time

59
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:56,063
even people such as Leonardo Da Vinci and
they proposed various designs of what

60
00:07:56,063 --> 00:08:02,062
could happen in the eye so as to avoid
this emotion not to do the recollection.

61
00:08:02,062 --> 00:08:09,036
But, this is really not so much of a big
deal. The point is that the brain can

62
00:08:09,036 --> 00:08:16,034
interpret the image the right way and for
a camera, it's life is particularly easy

63
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:23,024
because software can simply flip the image
drop down and right left and after we

64
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:29,088
apply this trick, what we get is much
nicer looking equations which is x = fX /

65
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:37,012
ZyF * Y / Z. So we got rid of the issue of
lateral emotion and top down flipping.

66
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:42,094
Good. So now, we are ready to start to
understand the mathematics of Perspective

67
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:48,097
projection. And, for this, I have picked
this drawing. It's actually drawing not an

68
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:54,093
image but since the drawing is trying to
be accurate about perspective, we can

69
00:08:54,093 --> 00:09:01,019
consider this. So, on this, in this image
which let's say corresponds to a camera

70
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:07,076
taking a picture of some telephone post
and some cat eye and a road and some grass

71
00:09:07,076 --> 00:09:14,017
and so forth, let's try to look for some
phenomena which arise due to perspective

72
00:09:14,017 --> 00:09:20,052
projection. So here's one. Parallel lines
in the image can merge to a vanishing

73
00:09:20,052 --> 00:09:26,046
point so the parallel lines that are
considered here are the feet of the radius

74
00:09:26,046 --> 00:09:32,056
pulls and the tops of the pulls. The tops
of the pulls is constringent at one line.

75
00:09:32,056 --> 00:09:38,013
The free to the pulls corresponds to
another line and the two sides of the

76
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:44,031
road. And all of these appear to converge
to a vanishing point. So note that this is

77
00:09:44,031 --> 00:09:50,016
a phenomenon of perspective. The Lines
themselves do not meet in 3-dimensional

78
00:09:50,016 --> 00:09:56,029
space they're parallel to each other but
the projection in the image are here to

79
00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:07,032
meet. So can we explain this? Okay. Here's
another observation. So we have that

80
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:15,024
nearer objects are lowered in the image so
here I denoted y1, y2, y3. The y

81
00:10:15,024 --> 00:10:24,013
coordinates of the feat of these pulls and
you'll notice that the nearer pull has

82
00:10:24,013 --> 00:10:35,038
foot y1 which is closer which is lower in
the image. Nearer objects are bigger. This

83
00:10:35,038 --> 00:10:40,050
again you should not be surprised. So
let's take up some of this properties and

84
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:47,040
try to prove them mathematically. So first
let's take up this property that parallel

85
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,028
lines can merge to a vanishing point. How
will we go about proving this? So let

86
00:10:53,028 --> 00:11:00,027
there be a point a and a direction vector
d and three dimensional space and what

87
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:07,088
we'll do now is to write down the equation
of point on this line and what can we say

88
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:14,087
about that? We can write the equation of a
general point on this line as, here are

89
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:26,089
the three coordinates x, y and z and these
are equal to A sub x, a sub y, a sub z. +

90
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:43,067
lambda * D sub x, d sub y, and d sub z. So
x here land so let me draw a picture here

91
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:54,017
so suppose we have. We have some point a
and the we consider some line going

92
00:11:54,017 --> 00:12:05,087
through it and that direction of this line
is d. And so we'll get a point here which

93
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:20,008
is a +. D and then there might be a point
here which is a + 2d. And there might be a

94
00:12:20,008 --> 00:12:28,092
point here which is a -d And so on so the
general way to think about it is that we

95
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:37,007
have this parameter lambda and lambda
ranges between it, it can go to infinity

96
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:45,032
in one direction or it can go to -infinity
to consider points to the other side.

97
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:54,034
Okay. So by [inaudible] we get different
points of this line, So let's now if we

98
00:12:54,034 --> 00:13:02,015
get on the projection of this point, how
do we do that? So, what's, let's look at

99
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:12,020
the x coordinate so we have this equation
x = fx upon z. So if we want to apply

100
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:27,090
this, we have f * x coordinate. It's going
to be a sub x + lambda d sub x. / what is

101
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:41,061
the c coordinate. It's going to be a sub
z. + lambda d sub z. Is that clear? Good.

102
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:49,062
So now what we can do is we want to figure
out what happens to this coordinate of

103
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:57,093
this projection point as the line goes to
infinity in three dimensional space so how

104
00:13:57,093 --> 00:14:11,058
do we find that? Let's consider Lambda
going to infinity. So then what's gonna

105
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:20,041
happen? What happens to this expression?
So in this expression, in the expression

106
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:29,035
for x essentially the dominant dome will
now become lambda dx / lambda dz which

107
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:39,095
will give you f. D sub x upon d sub z.
Okay? Now, the interesting thing here is

108
00:14:39,095 --> 00:15:03,023
that this expression. This expression Does
not Depend On a So therefore if we have a

109
00:15:03,023 --> 00:15:10,008
family of parallel lines, they all will
have the same direction d but they will go

110
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:16,060
through different points a but the
projection coordinate x does not depend on

111
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:29,001
that. So, in general. So what we have
shown is the coordinates of the projection

112
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:56,065
Rf d sub x upon d sub z For the x
coordinate. And read by analogy we, I

113
00:15:56,065 --> 00:16:19,083
haven't and By doing the same process For
y coordinate We get f d sub y upon d sub z

114
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:45,069
for the y coordinate, And does F d sub x
upon d sub z, f d sub y upon d sub z The

115
00:16:45,069 --> 00:17:04,066
coordinates Of the vanishing point Of this
family of [inaudible], Okay. Let's take a

116
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,069
break here.
