00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,020
Welcome again and last lecture we talked
about some properties of Perspective

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:10,054
Projection so I'm gonna continue with this
team today and try to derive a few more

3
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:15,082
interesting properties. So last time we
studied that parallel lines can merge to a

4
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:21,003
vanishing point. Today, we're gonna take
up the next property that are listed then

5
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:26,037
which is that nearer objects are lower in
the image. As you see here, by considering

6
00:00:26,037 --> 00:00:31,071
the polls and the bottoms of this polls in
this diagram. How do we go about proving

7
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:38,059
this? That's the question. So let's start
by noting that all of these objects are on

8
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:45,068
a ground plane. So, on a ground plane the
following is true, the y coordinate in the

9
00:00:45,068 --> 00:00:52,060
wall satisfies the condition that y= -h.
So, think of h as the height of the camera

10
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:59,006
or the person taking the picture. So if
the equation of the ground plane is y =

11
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:05,095
-h, then any point in the ground plane is
gonna have project to a y coordinate which

12
00:01:05,095 --> 00:01:12,044
is y = -fh over z. So that's just from the
equation of Perspective Projection. So,

13
00:01:12,044 --> 00:01:18,077
can we derive anything further? So, let's
just follow this through. So, suppose we

14
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:26,074
consider. Z going to infinity, so we're
considering follow a point. What will

15
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:34,022
happen to y? So y will go to zero. So,
okay, And now we can consider points which

16
00:01:34,022 --> 00:01:45,052
are closer to us. So if there are points
which are nearer to us. What will happen?

17
00:01:45,052 --> 00:02:00,034
We'll have y will be more negative. So
what does that mean? That means that it

18
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:14,013
will be lower in the image, So if we
consider the points here, These and so

19
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:24,018
forth. So we, we have points associated
with depths z1, z2, z3 and obviously z3 is

20
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:34,019
greater than z2 which is greater than z1.
And the associated y coordinates, they are

21
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:40,071
all negative And the y coordinate for the
point one is the most negative,

22
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:48,021
intermediate are the least negative. So in
other words, we see that nearer points are

23
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:55,012
going to be lower in the image plane.
Okay, here's another obvious kind of

24
00:02:55,012 --> 00:03:01,032
statement but we want to prove it using
our techniques that nearer objects look

25
00:03:01,032 --> 00:03:07,052
bigger. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
take up one of these, these, these poles.

26
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:17,043
A nd I'm gonna derive what it's length is
in the image. So its length in the wall is

27
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:25,059
going to be n. So, that's the height of
the object out in the wall. In the image,

28
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:33,022
we are going to consider the point
corresponding to its bottom and its bottom

29
00:03:33,022 --> 00:03:39,099
is that x, -h, z. So where does the -h
arise from? This is the height of the

30
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:51,084
camera. Okay, so what's the top of the
point going to be? So let's consider this

31
00:03:51,084 --> 00:03:59,098
location. So, it's the same x-coordinate,
the same z-coordinate but the y-coordinate

32
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:06,060
is different and it's larger by l. So, l
is the height, L is the height of the

33
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:13,075
object so this height is l. So, that gives
us the following equation for the top of

34
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:20,046
the object. And now, things are pretty
straight forward. We just have to derive

35
00:04:20,046 --> 00:04:36,067
what the bottom projects to. So, what is
the bottom projector? It's gonna project

36
00:04:36,067 --> 00:05:01,081
to fx upon z, -fh upon z. And what does
the top projector, Fx up on z, Fl-h upon

37
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:17,052
z. So, If I consider The difference
between this. What is that? That's

38
00:05:17,052 --> 00:05:25,073
essentially fl upon z. And that you can
think of is the vertical size of the image

39
00:05:25,073 --> 00:05:39,025
in the projection. And clearly they have
the property here that large Z Means That

40
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:50,048
This is smaller. So, in a similar way we
can prove whereas the properties that true

41
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:56,000
of an image created by Perspective
Projection. So, it's all quite straight

42
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,090
forward. You just have to apply these
rules, fx up on z, fy up on z and just try

43
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:07,095
to figure out what are the appropriate
choices of x, y, and z to plug in to these

44
00:06:07,095 --> 00:06:15,055
formulas. Let's try to get some more
infusion. But before we do that, I want

45
00:06:15,055 --> 00:06:21,029
you to have in mind the physical model
which are waves in motion. And I have

46
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:27,012
shown that here. So, imagine here that
there is a person who is standing there

47
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:34,039
looking at some object. This is the object
in the wall and what we do is we have a

48
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:42,099
pinhole, so this is going to be the
equivalent of the pinhole. But instead of

49
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:49,071
having the image plane which is at f
behind the pinhole, we imagine a virtual

50
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:56,036
image plane which is f in front of the
pinhole. So, it's just the, considering

51
00:06:56,036 --> 00:07:03,000
the same f but we are putting it in front
rat her than in the back as we had

52
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,044
earlier, instead of what we had earlier.
Okay, what [inaudible] going to do this?

53
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:15,059
So essentially, you can imagine that you
have a transfer in sheet, so you have a

54
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:21,051
transfer in piece of glass which you put
at a distance of f in front of the

55
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:27,035
pinhole. So, the image is clear to as
follows. And again the similar triangle

56
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:33,082
reasoning will go through and we will be
able to derive the projection equations, x

57
00:07:33,082 --> 00:07:39,013
= fx upon z, y is fy upon z. And now
What's cool about this is that you got

58
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:44,039
through the other mind of signs. So In my
last picture, I talked about getting

59
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:49,095
either minus signs and software or just
inverting the image top down and left to

60
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:55,043
right. Here, you can think of this is a
physical model which you can keep in your

61
00:07:55,043 --> 00:08:00,071
head as a way in which perspective
projection happens with no sign inversion.

62
00:08:00,071 --> 00:08:05,099
So, one way to think about is that this is
how an artist operates. An artist is

63
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:11,061
trying to paint a picture of an external
world on an easel. So, this is going to be

64
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:18,058
a kind of the artist's easel. On which he
or she is trying to paint this picture of

65
00:08:18,058 --> 00:08:26,016
a tree outside. And they want the, the
picture to be such that a person situated

66
00:08:26,016 --> 00:08:33,074
at the right location would get exactly
the same set of rays from the painting as.

67
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:40,032
He or she would get from the real world
and then obviously they would, they would

68
00:08:40,032 --> 00:08:46,037
imagine the construction like one I've
shown here. So, what this makes very clear

69
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:52,057
is that, what's very important is the
location of the pinhole sometimes we will

70
00:08:52,057 --> 00:09:00,003
call this the center of projection Because
all the rays which form the image go

71
00:09:00,003 --> 00:09:06,097
through the center of projection. And
Perspective Projection is really a mapping

72
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:12,047
from points in three-dimensional-space,
xyz to this collection of rays and what's

73
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:17,077
the collection of rays we are talking
about? All the rays which go through the

74
00:09:17,077 --> 00:09:22,080
center of projection and that abbreviated
sometimes as COP. So this is the

75
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,030
fundamental way to think about it, what,
once you see it this way, you realize that

76
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:33,081
the projection surface. The projection
surface that we considered here, it is not

77
00:09:33,081 --> 00:09:39,028
very important. I mean, we can put it, put
a plane there, we could put a sphere so

78
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:44,048
you could imagine that you have a
transparent globe and the center of that

79
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:49,086
globe is the pinhole or whatever smooth
surface you like. It doesn't matter. We

80
00:09:49,086 --> 00:09:55,003
just need some way of recording the
intersection of rays on to a surface. So,

81
00:09:55,003 --> 00:10:00,048
this shows up some kind of discussions
when people are confused that when in, in

82
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:06,000
human perception, images are created in
the retina and the retina is not flat and

83
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,045
it's not exactly spherical. It doesn't
matter, All you need is a way to record in

84
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:16,075
a one to one fashion the set of rays going
through the pinhole. And each ray

85
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:22,069
corresponding to a set of points of the
three-dimensional-space. Thinking of it

86
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:28,004
this way also makes some other intrusions
more evident. What's the right way to

87
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:33,006
measure image size? So, we could think
about different ways of doing it. You

88
00:10:33,006 --> 00:10:38,062
could measure image size and pixels. You
could measure it in microns and the image

89
00:10:38,062 --> 00:10:44,017
sensor. But, let me argue to you that the
right way to measure image size is visual

90
00:10:44,017 --> 00:10:49,059
angle so I've shown that in this diagram.
So, we have some object out in the wall,

91
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:55,034
and it creates a certain image. But what I
can do is to measure the length of this

92
00:10:55,034 --> 00:11:01,014
image with this visual angle theta and
this is the visual angle subtended at the

93
00:11:01,014 --> 00:11:06,086
center projection. How do we measure this
theta in a standard way? By radiance or

94
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:14,002
degrees or whatever. So, this is a major
of, a natural major image size. And once

95
00:11:14,002 --> 00:11:22,012
you have this major image size, you can of
course always convert this into size on

96
00:11:22,012 --> 00:11:29,063
the, on the image plane because we're
going to have a simple relationship. So,

97
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:40,011
theta is equal to sum l upon f, where f is
the, the distance Between center of

98
00:11:40,011 --> 00:11:50,011
projection and the image plane. So, but
measuring the size of an object on the

99
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:56,005
image plane in degrees therefore is a very
natural thing. So, we do this all the time

100
00:11:56,005 --> 00:12:01,071
when we talk about field of e view of
cameras of the field of view of the human

101
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:07,051
visual system. We always describe that in
terms of degrees. We don't measure it out

102
00:12:07,051 --> 00:12:13,010
in terms of megapixels o r number of cons
and so on. Degrees is, subtended at the

103
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:21,032
center of projection is the natural unit.
I'll give you some examples of what one

104
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:28,048
can do once you realize that this is the
natural unit. We can. We can calculate for

105
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:34,044
some common objects on what size the
subtend on the on the [inaudible]. So

106
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:40,079
let's take the example of the human head.
So the average human head is nine inches

107
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:46,027
high. So, suppose that we are looking at a
person who is nine feet away. So, then,

108
00:12:46,027 --> 00:12:52,049
what you're going to get is angle theta is
gonna be one upon twelve because there are

109
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:58,015
twelve inches in a foot, So this one upon
twelve is in radiance of course so that

110
00:12:58,015 --> 00:13:03,088
corresponds to 4.8 degrees. So, if the
person was at eighteen feet what would we

111
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:10,066
get? You would get. That the head
[inaudible] 2.4 degrees. So, note that

112
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:16,068
this gives you a way of measuring distance
because let's assume that all human heads

113
00:13:16,068 --> 00:13:22,014
are roughly the same. So, the beam has
access to the, the size subtended on the

114
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:27,067
retina. So is it, if, if the size is 2.5
degrees you can say I'm looking at a

115
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:33,079
person who is eighteen feet away. So, this
is quite convenient. Let me conclude my

116
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:40,037
discussion of perspective by trying to
capture the big story which I think can be

117
00:13:40,037 --> 00:13:46,087
summarized in two main principles. First
principle is that objects which are part

118
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:53,037
of it looks smaller. Looks smaller meaning
that the angles up tended on the image

119
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:59,085
plane is smaller. And the basic factor is
the scaling factor of one over z. So when

120
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:04,090
z is larger, you'll gonna get a smaller
projection on the image. So we have

121
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:10,070
studied this in great detail already. The
second effect which I wanna point out is

122
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:16,009
that for sharpening. Objects that are
slanted with respect to the line of sight

123
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:21,061
project to smaller sizes on the image
plane. And this killing factor here is

124
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:27,091
Cosine Sigma. So let me define sigma. So
sigma here is, is shown in this figure. So

125
00:14:27,091 --> 00:14:34,091
we have the line of sight from the eye and
then we have the surface normal. The

126
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:41,023
surface normal to the surface which I have
shown here in blue And sigma is the angle

127
00:14:41,023 --> 00:14:47,003
between the two. So, if a surface is dir
ectly in front of us, sigma will be zero.

128
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:52,076
If the surface is completely edged on,
then sigma will be 90 degrees. So, sigma

129
00:14:52,076 --> 00:14:59,001
is the angle between the line of sight and
the surface normal. And sometimes we call

130
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:09,067
sigma, the surface slant. And, essentially
this is gonna cause a further diminishing

131
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:15,061
in size by a factor of cosine sigma. We
can get into this in more mathematically

132
00:15:15,061 --> 00:15:21,078
precise in a more mathematically precise
way later. But, I think you can get this

133
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:26,075
notion quite intuitively. So, these are
the two main effects of perspective

134
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:32,003
projection, this [inaudible] effect and a
[inaudible] effect. This is why if we have

135
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:37,044
a circle in the wall, it will typically
project to an ellipse and the ratio of the

136
00:15:37,044 --> 00:15:42,079
major to minor axis is going to be related
to how the circular disk is arrayed with

137
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:48,078
respect to the line of sight. Finally, I
want to conclude by talking about an

138
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:55,014
approximation to Perspective Projection
called Orthographic Projection and we use

139
00:15:55,014 --> 00:16:01,065
this quite a lot. And the reason is that
it makes the mathematics much simpler at

140
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:06,042
in certain times. When is this
approximation valid? This is an

141
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:12,027
approximation to perspective and you're
looking at an object which doesn't have

142
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:18,048
that much depth variation inside it and is
relatively following. So imagine that here

143
00:16:18,048 --> 00:16:24,048
is the, the camera indicated by the eye
and you're looking at some object and this

144
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:29,074
distance might be like twenty feet or
something like that. And, the depth

145
00:16:29,074 --> 00:16:35,086
variation within the object is more like
one foot. So that's the kind of scenario.

146
00:16:35,086 --> 00:16:42,024
You're looking at some smallish object
relative to the distance that it is with

147
00:16:42,024 --> 00:16:48,037
respect to the camera. So, what happens
there? Let's derive some equations here.

148
00:16:48,037 --> 00:16:59,067
So essentially, the perspective effect is
going to give me that x = fx up on Z1 And

149
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:14,075
x2 is fx2 up on z2, Okay. Now, what we can
do is to assume that this f up on z1 and f

150
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:25,000
up on z2 are approximately the same. So,
if f up on z1 approximately, f up on z2.

151
00:17:26,022 --> 00:17:38,004
In which case we can then say x1 is sum
alpha times x1. And x2 is alpha * x2.

152
00:17:38,004 --> 00:17:50,017
Okay. So, this of course is the So, this
is image, it's the im age quantities. So,

153
00:17:50,017 --> 00:17:58,067
what we have here is just scaling. So, a
scaling of, of the x-coordinate. And what

154
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:07,007
we'll we do for the y-coordinate? It's
gonna be [inaudible] of the y1 is alpha

155
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:20,063
times. Y1 and y2 is alpha * y2. So, when
can we make this assumption that f up on

156
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:27,068
z1 is roughly the same as f up on z2.
It's, it's when the change in depth

157
00:18:27,068 --> 00:18:40,070
inside. So when z1 - z2 is small, Relative
to, To z, and that's the setting image we

158
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:46,001
make Orthographic Projection. So
Orthographic Projection make you just

159
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:51,060
assume that there's a constant factor of
[inaudible] do to the distance and the

160
00:18:51,060 --> 00:19:02,025
distance is assumed to be approximately
the same for the whole object, Okay, Thank
