1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,003
Okay, welcome back. So in the last
lecture, we derived the equations for

2
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:10,084
optical flow. In this lecture we're going
to study them in greater depth, and show

3
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:16,045
what use they provide us for computer
vision, or, in fact, any biological vision

4
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:22,013
system. So let me begin by reminding you
of the equations which we derived last

5
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:27,095
time. These were shown last time, and the
way to understand. These, is that there is

6
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:33,042
a transitional component and a rotation
component. I want to make one bit of

7
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:38,067
notation clear. These, these are vector
equations, so they are, I've kind of

8
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:45,017
written them out in a compact way, But
These are two vector equations, which

9
00:00:45,017 --> 00:00:52,060
really consist of the two, two scalar
equations. So in fact, if I take this,

10
00:00:52,060 --> 00:01:00,054
This, this matrix vector multiplication,
and I can read out. I will get two rows.

11
00:01:00,054 --> 00:01:05,077
And similarly I will get two rows here,
and these are also two rows. So if we

12
00:01:05,077 --> 00:01:10,073
consider the first row, I will, that
corresponds to the equation for X start,

13
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:15,096
and the bottom row corresponds to the
equation for Y dot. So just to make clear

14
00:01:15,096 --> 00:01:21,032
that I have expressed in a compact way
using vector notation what really are two

15
00:01:21,032 --> 00:01:26,028
separate equations, one for the X
component of the optical flow, and one for

16
00:01:26,028 --> 00:01:31,064
the Y component of the optical flow. So
let's go, going and first we'll concern

17
00:01:31,064 --> 00:01:39,013
ourselves with the transitional component
on this red stuff here. So, what's the

18
00:01:39,013 --> 00:01:46,071
optical flow pure translation? If the
motion is purely translation we can ignore

19
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:52,094
the rotational component because the omega
is a, a zero. Omega x omega by omega Z a

20
00:01:52,094 --> 00:01:59,010
zero, and then the flow field is given by
these two expressions, this is just from

21
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:04,004
the previous slide, just substitute
omega=0. Okay, I want to get some

22
00:02:04,004 --> 00:02:10,043
intuition about this, how am I going to do
this? Because just leaving this as formula

23
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:15,059
is, is, doesn't give us proper
understanding, So we're going to gain

24
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:22,049
intuition by considering this special case
of translation along the optical axis. So

25
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:29,024
what's this special case? So this is, this
translation, but the translation is along

26
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:35,041
the z axis. So imagine that there is a
camera moving. But its movement is just

27
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:40,073
movement along the z axis. There is no
movement along x and y. There is no

28
00:02:40,073 --> 00:02:45,075
rotation. So imagine that you're just
looking straight ahead, and you're walking

29
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:50,080
in the direction in which you're looking.
Right? This is what most of us should do

30
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,098
most of the time. What does the flow field
become? We can start with the expressions

31
00:02:55,098 --> 00:03:00,059
here, and we can substitute that t sub X,
and t sub Y as zero. So we get the

32
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:06,035
expressions shown here for the X component
of the optical flow U, and the Y component

33
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:12,022
of the optical flow. And let me do my
standard trick of writing these two scalar

34
00:03:12,022 --> 00:03:17,025
equations as one vector equation and
that's what I do here. So this U, V

35
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:23,013
transposed really means little U, little V
as a vector, and this X, Y transposed as X

36
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:28,058
and Y as a vector. So these are column
vectors, and here these are row vectors,

37
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:37,026
which have been transposed with a letter T
[sound]. Okay. [sound]. So we get a fairly

38
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:43,043
simple looking expression. So the optical
flow vector is proportional to the

39
00:03:43,043 --> 00:03:49,012
position vector x, y, and the
proportionality factor is tz upon z. Let's

40
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:56,022
see if we can plot this out. Okay, so I
repeat. Uv is, is, UV the optical flow

41
00:03:56,022 --> 00:04:02,073
vector, the optical flow vector here, this
is the position vector and the

42
00:04:02,073 --> 00:04:09,088
proportionality constant is TZ upon Z.
This diagram shows what the optical flow

43
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:17,076
field looks like in this case. So first of
all, what happens when we are at the

44
00:04:17,076 --> 00:04:25,006
origin? So the origin here, So at the
origin x=0, y=0. So the optical flow must

45
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:31,025
be zero. Uv must be 0,0 And the origin. So
that's shown here, by the, this is the

46
00:04:31,025 --> 00:04:36,078
origin of the image plane. And at the
origin what we should have is the optical

47
00:04:36,078 --> 00:04:42,018
flow vectors are of length zero. The
optical flow vector is a scalar multiple

48
00:04:42,018 --> 00:04:47,071
of the position vector. This has a very
simple meaning. This means that all, if I

49
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:56,002
have a point. X, Y So there is,
essentially, the position vector which is

50
00:04:56,002 --> 00:05:02,065
drawn here in blue. The optical flow
vector at the location XY is in the same

51
00:05:02,065 --> 00:05:10,011
direction, scaled by some factor, and that
sca-, factor is TZ upon Z. And but it

52
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:17,002
points in the s-, in the direction of, the
position vector XY. So this means that,

53
00:05:17,002 --> 00:05:23,043
all the, the optical flow, so, at this
location here, XY. The position vector is

54
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:30,051
going to be like this. So the optical flow
vector is in, a scaled copy of that, The

55
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:37,042
scaling factor being given by TZ upon Z.
So the optical flow pattern has this very

56
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:43,064
beautiful starburst like Pattern to it.
All these vectors appear to be streaming

57
00:05:43,064 --> 00:05:49,070
out; actually they are streaming out when
we are approaching an object. So imagine

58
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:55,042
that I am driving, and I am driving
headlong towards a wall. So the wall is

59
00:05:55,042 --> 00:06:01,095
ahead of me at ten meters. Its Z is
constant at ten meters, and I'm driving

60
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:08,049
towards it. Well, I hope I'll break at
some point, but before I do, I see this

61
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:15,011
optical flow pattern, which is all these
arrows streaming out. Okay. What will

62
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:21,035
happen if I was? Reverse in the car, if I
was driving back. Well, at that point what

63
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:27,023
will happen is that the sign of TZ will,
will flip. So all these vectors, instead

64
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:32,096
of pointing outwards would be pointing
inwards. So when I'm driving towards a

65
00:06:32,096 --> 00:06:38,040
wall, the optical flow is streaming
outwards. When I'm driving away from a

66
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:44,006
wall, I, I'm reversing from a wall, the
optical flow vectors will be streaming

67
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:50,033
inwards. And this proportional artifact is
TZ upon Z. So that's, that's a very nice

68
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:56,040
property of the optical flow field. The
lengths of these vectors are proportional

69
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:02,026
to TZ upon Z, and let's try to get a
better understanding of that. Okay, there

70
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:09,043
is one little problem which confronts us
in our, in our analysis of the optical

71
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:16,006
flow-field corresponding to pure
translation. So the, the, this property is

72
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:23,034
called the Scale Factor Ambiguity. So
imagine that I took the... The world, and

73
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:29,082
I made the world K times bigger, and I
made mov, my movement K times faster. So I

74
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:36,037
made the world Z becomes KZ. So imagine
that everything in the world is twice as

75
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:42,076
big, and I move twice as fast. What'll
happen to the optical flow? Since TZ upon

76
00:07:42,076 --> 00:07:49,056
Z, that ratio is not going to be changed;
the optical flow field will be exactly the

77
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:55,074
same. So this is something we have known
how to exploit for quite s ome time.

78
00:07:55,074 --> 00:08:01,065
People in the movie making business can
make these tiny toy sets with a tiny

79
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:07,080
Godzilla and a tiny building. And then
they have, they can move the camera only a

80
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:13,064
little bit, but the optical flow may be
the same as if you had a fast moving

81
00:08:13,064 --> 00:08:19,080
camera and a larger world. So the optical
flow vector is unchanged. This tells us

82
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,084
that we have no hope of recovering the
absolute. Speed TZ or the absolute depth

83
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:31,084
Z. So in a sense this is bad news because
our goal was to use the optical field,

84
00:08:31,084 --> 00:08:37,069
flow field to tell us something about
depth in the scene. And there is no way

85
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:43,061
out. There is no way to recover absolute
depth in meters and absolute speed in

86
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:49,069
meters per second. But there is one little
important thing we can do, In fact the

87
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:55,054
most important thing with respect to
navigation. I want you to tell me what Z

88
00:08:55,054 --> 00:09:06,041
upon TZ is. So the units of z, z is a
distance In meters. D sub z is a speed In

89
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:13,062
meters/ second. Okay. What is this ratio
tell me? This ratio is, so imagine there

90
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:20,074
is a wall at a distance of Z and I am
going at speed t/Z directly towards it.

91
00:09:20,074 --> 00:09:30,032
Well Z upon tZ is the time to collision.
So you can work out that the units of this

92
00:09:30,032 --> 00:09:37,018
are in seconds. So z upon tz is, is in how
many seconds am I going to collide with

93
00:09:37,018 --> 00:09:43,087
the wall. So, and here the scale factor
ambiguity doesn't come into play because.

94
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:49,035
It could be that the z is in kilometers,
and t sub z is in kilometers per second,

95
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:54,082
or z is in meters and tz is in meters per
second. It's the ratio that matters. If

96
00:09:54,082 --> 00:10:00,042
you're moving faster, but the world is, is
bigger, it will take you the same time to

97
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:05,038
collision, or time to contact. So, the
important point is that this

98
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:12,017
proportionality factor tells us about the
time to collision. And now, here is a bit

99
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:16,086
of advice. If you are driving towards a
wall just keep the time to contact

100
00:10:16,086 --> 00:10:22,017
positive. That will keep you out of
trouble. So, in fact, this advice seems to

101
00:10:22,017 --> 00:10:28,015
be followed by insects and bugs and so on
and so forth. There have been quite a few

102
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:33,093
experiments done by biologists, which
demonstrate that time to contact is a very

103
00:10:33,093 --> 00:10:39,027
valuable variable, which is in f act used.
So, what you do is, you can control

104
00:10:39,027 --> 00:10:44,089
essentially breaking behavior, by making
down decrees as, as appropriate as, okay.

105
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:50,077
I'm not gonna get, get into the details of
those studies. But The beautiful result is

106
00:10:50,077 --> 00:10:55,078
that from the optical flow field we can
determine time to contact, which is in

107
00:10:55,078 --> 00:11:00,086
fact the variable we want to use for
controlling our braking behavior, so as to

108
00:11:00,086 --> 00:11:06,098
avoid colliding with obstacles. Let me now
turn to the case of general translation. I

109
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:12,042
did, now the bush, the baby case
corresponding to translation along the

110
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:18,034
optical axis. What happens when we
consider a general translation? So we have

111
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:24,091
a piece of X, a piece of Y, and a piece of
Z. So to work this out, let's start with

112
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:32,023
the figuring out when is the optical flow
00. So in the previous case the optical

113
00:11:32,023 --> 00:11:38,093
flow is zero at the origin. In this case
the optical flow will be zero at the

114
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:46,065
following points. Let's figure out. When
the X component of optical flow is zero,

115
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:55,043
minus X plus minus T sub X plus X T sub Z
equals zero. X should be equal to T sub X

116
00:11:55,043 --> 00:12:04,042
upon T sub Z. Minus T sub Y plus Y T sub Z
should be zero which implies that Y equals

117
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:13,026
T sub Y upon T sub Z. What this tells me
is, if I consider the point. Tx upon TC,

118
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:33,030
Ts of Y on Ts of Z, at this location the
optical flow. Uv is 0,0. So, this point Tx

119
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:39,038
upon tz, ty upon tz is the moral
equivalent of the origin in the previous

120
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:53,086
case. We will call this point. The focus
of expansion And, let me do a little

121
00:12:53,086 --> 00:13:00,013
calculation to show why this term is
appropriate. What we should do is, let's

122
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:06,064
take the optical flow fee, but let's do a
change of coordinates. So, imagine that

123
00:13:06,064 --> 00:13:13,007
instead of taking the standard origin,
which is zero, zero. Let's consider a new

124
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:19,003
origin, and let's make the new origin at
the point TX upon TZ And TY upon

125
00:13:19,003 --> 00:13:25,036
[inaudible]. So therefore, we have changed
coordinates from X to X prime, and Y to Y

126
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:31,053
prime by just a simple shift. So in this
diagram, I have XY, which is the standard

127
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:37,084
coordinate system. And then I have a new
coordinate system for X prime, Y prime. So

128
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:44,098
the optical flow field in the
neo-coordinate system. So let's go back to

129
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:50,098
the expression here. So, here we have the
optical flow field in the XY coordinate

130
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:56,076
system, and instead we want to write it
out in the X prime Y prime coordinate

131
00:13:56,076 --> 00:14:02,061
system. And we'll do a change of color,
origin from XY to X prime Y prime, and

132
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:08,069
rewrite these expressions in the X prime Y
prime coordinate system. Again, I leave

133
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:14,077
you to work this out, but if you do that,
you are going to get an expression which

134
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:22,085
now looks very simple. It is that uv. In
the x prime, y prime coordinate system has

135
00:14:22,085 --> 00:14:34,038
the simple tz upon z. X prime, Y prime. So
we again get this scale factor

136
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:42,084
relationship. That we saw in the, the easy
case, but now we have to refer everything

137
00:14:42,084 --> 00:14:50,067
to a new coordinates system at TX upon TC,
TY upon TC. So the, we'll call this TX

138
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:58,039
upon TC at, at, TY upon TC to be F, the
F-foy, [sound] F-foy is how we abbreviate

139
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:08,014
it but this corresponds to the focus of
expansion [sound]. And why do we use the

140
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:14,021
stub? Recall that in the, in the case of
translation along the Z axis, the optical

141
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:20,044
flow vectors appeared to stream outwards
from the origin, and we could call the

142
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:26,020
origin the focus of expansion, because
that's the point from which all these

143
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:32,035
vectors appear to be streaming outwards.
Here, these vectors will be streaming out

144
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:38,042
with respect to the point TX upon TZ, TY
upon TZ. So these are the coordinates of

145
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:44,075
the focus of expansion. So in a sense if I
have an optical flow field all I have to

146
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:50,049
do is look and it corresponds to peer
translation. There will be a point at

147
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:56,062
which the flow field is zero at which the
flow is zero and all the vectors will

148
00:15:56,062 --> 00:16:02,044
appear to be streaming out from there.
That is the focus of expansion. And the

149
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:08,013
focus of expansion directly tells me about
the direction of translation, because it,

150
00:16:08,013 --> 00:16:13,061
the coordinates of the focus of expansion
give me tx upon tz, ty upon tz. So this

151
00:16:13,061 --> 00:16:18,082
basically is information about the
translation vector t. It does not have

152
00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:24,046
absolute information about the magnitude
of DX comma DY comma DZ. But we can never

153
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:30,023
get hope to get that because of the scale
factor ambiguity. All we can hope to do is

154
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:36,000
to r ecover the direction of transmission.
And the location of the focus of expansion

155
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,021
gives us exactly that. [sound]. So, now we
have understood the case of translation,

156
00:16:43,021 --> 00:16:49,047
Which is which is beautiful Because the
case of translation. It shows us that we

157
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:56,030
cannot recover the absolute velocity of
translation. We can recover the time to

158
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:03,030
collision; we can recover the direction
the direction of translation. Of course,

159
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:09,088
in the general case we don't just have
translation, we also have rotation. So

160
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:17,040
this rotation component is, is described
here. This is the rotation component. So I

161
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:22,080
could. Spend a few slides on trying to
understand the rotation component. So

162
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:28,038
imagine that there is no translation at
all, the camera is just rotating. Well. I

163
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:33,092
can do that, but there is really not that
much insight there. It's kind of boring.

164
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:39,032
If you move the, if you rotate the camera,
well the ball will appear to rotate. But

165
00:17:39,032 --> 00:17:44,060
it tells you nothing whatsoever about the,
the distance of objects in the world

166
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:50,020
Because if you see this expression, Z does
not figure. It only depends on image plane

167
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:55,033
coordinates with X and Y, which we know.
And. The omega vector, omega x, omega y,

168
00:17:55,033 --> 00:18:00,092
omega z, So therefore the flow field, the
rotational flow field will tell us what's,

169
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:06,045
hap, how we are rotating. So it will tell
us information about omega. It won't tell

170
00:18:06,045 --> 00:18:11,093
us anything about the C. So, so here is a
straightforward story. Now, if we have

171
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:17,040
translation and rotation going on at the
same time, then algorithmitically we do

172
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:23,021
have a challenge of trying to separate the
translational and rotational components. A

173
00:18:23,021 --> 00:18:29,009
number of algorithms have been developed
for that, but I won't get into the details

174
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:34,036
of that. What I'm gonna do know, is to
just show you some pictures of the flow

175
00:18:34,036 --> 00:18:41,073
fields and how they reveal information
about the scene. [sound]. So here's an

176
00:18:41,073 --> 00:18:48,045
example. This is what the flow field looks
like if I'm translating along the Z axis

177
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:54,093
towards a wall edge. So there is a focus
of expansion, which is at the origin. All

178
00:18:54,093 --> 00:19:01,065
these vectors are streaming out because
I'm driving towards the wall. And that' s

179
00:19:01,065 --> 00:19:08,077
about it. It's, there's a focus of
expansion is at the origin. And we have

180
00:19:08,077 --> 00:19:16,074
information in the lengths of these
vectors about the time to contact. Okay,

181
00:19:16,074 --> 00:19:22,070
this is what the optical flow looks like
for points on a road. So here I'm

182
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:29,071
imagining that I'm driving on a road and
so the upper half of the image plane is

183
00:19:29,071 --> 00:19:36,008
the sky. The lower half of the image plane
is the, the ground. There is a horizon

184
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:42,085
here if you like and the optical flow
vectors are, are, so here the Z varies. So

185
00:19:42,085 --> 00:19:49,013
since the Z varies, these are nearer
points. And these are points essentially

186
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:53,085
at infinity. These are far points. So,
recall that in the optical flow

187
00:19:53,085 --> 00:19:59,026
translational component there is a one
upon z factor, so when z is at infinity,

188
00:19:59,026 --> 00:20:05,007
the optical flow has to be zero. And when
points are nearer, the optical flow is

189
00:20:05,007 --> 00:20:10,038
larger. So this is what the flow looks
like on the road. And, you can have a

190
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:16,004
chance to experience this, particularly
when you're driving after it has rained.

191
00:20:16,004 --> 00:20:21,085
So the, the water on the, water drops on
the road surface, they enable you to sense

192
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:27,016
the optical flow more vividly, and you
will exactly perceive these vectors.

193
00:20:28,003 --> 00:20:34,019
Another way to think about this is that.
The focus of expansion is really the

194
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:40,094
vanishing point corresponding to the, the
vector of translation, because when I'm

195
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:46,071
driving. Every point in the road is moving
with velocity minus T. So these are all

196
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:52,015
vectors, and these are all parallel to
each other. So there must be a vanishing

197
00:20:52,015 --> 00:20:57,073
point of this family of parallel lines.
And what is that vanishing point? That is

198
00:20:57,073 --> 00:21:03,017
the focus of expansion. So the focus of
expansion is, really, just the vanishing

199
00:21:03,017 --> 00:21:08,091
point that we studied earlier in disguise.
Okay. This is the truly boding case. So

200
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:14,075
imagine that, I am translating along the
X-axis in front of a wall. So I am just

201
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:20,045
moving the camera to the side, the wall
that's in some fixed distance. Nothing

202
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:26,021
changes. The optical flow is as boding as
you get. Okay, here is the optical flow

203
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:32,005
field when you keep rotating the camera
about its axis. So you get this rotational

204
00:21:32,005 --> 00:21:38,003
pattern, it tells us what you are doing to
the camer A. It doesn't tell us anything

205
00:21:38,003 --> 00:21:44,002
about whether the wall is near or far, or
whether we are going to collide with it in

206
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:50,077
five seconds or 5,000 seconds. Here's an
interesting case. This is rotating about

207
00:21:50,077 --> 00:21:56,056
the Y axes which giving the coordinates
system we like to use in camera's is, is

208
00:21:56,056 --> 00:22:02,071
vertical. So when you rotating about the y
axis this is what the flow field will look

209
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:10,027
like. Let me conclude by talking about the
importance of optical flow. The big idea

210
00:22:10,027 --> 00:22:15,089
that I want you to take away from these
last few lectures is that, suppose an

211
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:21,038
animal or a robot could analyze its radio
signal, and measure the optical flow

212
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:26,079
field. It could use this data to compute
depth and [inaudible] motion depth, Z

213
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:33,078
affects Y And ego motion which is the
translational and rotational velocity. You

214
00:22:33,078 --> 00:22:40,009
may not get exactly the Z or exactly the
T, you may, you may get some ratios of

215
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:46,017
that but that is good enough for
controlling your movement. There is a fair

216
00:22:46,017 --> 00:22:52,072
amount of evidence from perceptual and
neuroscience studies that animals in fact

217
00:22:52,072 --> 00:22:59,012
have both the ability to measure optical
flow. So this is required so there is some

218
00:22:59,012 --> 00:23:04,089
neural hardware that is needed to measure
optical flow given the imagine of the

219
00:23:04,089 --> 00:23:10,066
function of time. Given the video data And
That, given that we have computed the

220
00:23:10,066 --> 00:23:16,021
optical flow. Given that we have measured
the optical flow. Can we use it, to

221
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:24,017
control. A moment, avoid obstacles, et
cetera, and flies use it, diving birds use

222
00:23:24,017 --> 00:23:31,089
it. Many, many animals use it, and we
could use it for robots. There is in this

223
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:38,053
whole enterprise this req, requirement
that we must have a way of computing the

224
00:23:38,053 --> 00:23:44,065
optical flow field given reduced signal.
And I have not told you how to do that.

225
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:50,022
This requires work; it's not trivial
because essentially to measure the optical

226
00:23:50,022 --> 00:23:55,038
flow we need a way to know what are
corresponding points over time. So if

227
00:23:55,038 --> 00:24:01,016
there is a location XY in one time frame
and then I say that this point has moved

228
00:24:01,016 --> 00:24:05,082
to x+delta, x comma y+delta y. I need a
way to say that this is that there is a

229
00:24:05,082 --> 00:24:11,054
notion of corresponding points over time.
And this requires an algorithm and some

230
00:24:11,054 --> 00:24:17,054
computation. We are going to study that
later. For now I've just shown you how, if

231
00:24:17,054 --> 00:24:24,009
we could measure the optical f, flow field
we could use it for a number of useful

232
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:26,051
Applications. Thank you.
