/*
   A Simple OpenCV Tutorial
   by Jean-Marc Pelletier (c)2009

   This program identifies edges and contours in the camera image. When the user clicks inside a closed path, the area of the contour immediately enclosing the mouse pointer is 
   written out.

   The user can start or stop the image by pressing the space bar and quit the application by pressing the "esc" key.

   This tutorial is meant to show the basic structure of a simple OpenCV application. Furthermore, it shows how one can work with sequences and contours, which are important
   parts of OpenCV that could be better documented.

		//We then detect edges in the image using the Canny algorithm. This will return a binary image, one where the pixel values will be 255 for

		//The edges returned by the Canny algorithm might have small holes in them, which will cause some problems during contour detection.
		//The simplest way to solve this problem is to "dilate" the image. This is a morphological operator that will set any pixel in a binary image to 255 (on) 
		//if it has one neighbour that is not 0. The result of this is that edges grow fatter and small holes are filled in.

		//Once we have a binary image, we can look for contours in it. cvFindContours will scan through the image and store connected contours in "storage".
		//"contours" will point to the first contour detected. CV_RETR_TREE means that the function will create a contour hierarchy. Each contour will contain 
		//a pointer to contours that are contained inside it (holes). CV_CHAIN_APPROX_NONE means that all the contours points will be stored. Finally, an offset
		//value can be specified, but we set it to (0,0).
