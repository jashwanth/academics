Word Alignment
</h1>
</center>


   <b>Word alignment</b> is not a particularly difficult concept,
but it is fairly important, because it does show up in unusual places.
<h3>
What you know
</h3>
    We've defined a <i>word</i> to mean 4 bytes.  To store a word
in byte-addressable memory (i.e. where each element of memory
is one byte), you have to break up the 32 bit quantity into 4 bytes.
Thus, if the word was <b>0x01ab23cd</b>, it's broken up into 
<b>0x01</b>, <b>0xab</b>, <b>0x23</b>, <b>0xcd</b>.  
<p>
    You can store this in two ways.  If it's big endian, than the most
significant byte (i.e., <b>0x01</b>) is stored in the smallest of four
consective addresses.  The data <b>0xab</b>, <b>0x23</b>, <b>0xcx</b>
are stored in the following three memory addresses.  Thus, if you
stored the first byte in address 1000, the remaining bytes are stored
in addresses 1001, 1002, and 1003.  
</p><p>
   For little endian, you store the least significant byte (<b>0xcd</b>)
in the smallest address (in our example, this is address 1000),
then <b>0x23</b>, <b>0xab</b>, and <b>0x01</b>.   Thus, it's stored
in reverse order.
</p><p>
   Even though it's somewhat inaccurate to say this, we say a word is
stored at, say, address 1000.  That is, we pick the smallest address,
and say that's where the data is located in memory.   Thus, if the
data has N bytes, then it is stored in address <b>A</b> to
<b>A + N - 1</b>, and we say that the data is at address <b>A</b>.

</p><h3>
Word alignment
</h3>
   <i>However</i>, there's a second issue.  For reasons of making
hardware simpler (and sometimes because the ISA defines it this way),
words are often stored at <i>word aligned</i> addresses.
<p>
   Word-aligned means the address is stored at an address
that's divisible by 4.  If you look at an address that's
divisible by 4 and written in binary, you see that the last
two bits are 0.
</p><p>
   Why is this interesting?  Whenever you're dealing with word
quantities they must appear at word aligned addresses.  Consider
the following structure (written in C++):
<font size="+2">
<pre>struct Foo {
   char x ;  <font color="red">// 1 byte</font>
   int y ;   <font color="red">// 4 byte, must be word-aligned</font>
   char z ;  <font color="red">// 1 byte</font>
   int w ;   <font color="red">// 4 byte, must be word-aligned</font>
} ;
</pre>
</font>
  In C/C++, data is stored in the order declared.  Thus, <b>x</b>, 
<b>y</b>, <b>z</b>, and <b>w</b> appear in that order in memory.
</p><p>
  In principle, the amount of memory needed by <b>Foo</b> should be 10
bytes (1 byte for each <b>char</b>, 4 bytes for each <b>int</b>
variable).  
</p><p>
   <i>However</i>, due to word aligment, it will probably take more
than 10 bytes.  In particular, if <b>y</b> and <b>w</b> are both
word aligned, and <b>z</b> is in between, there will be 3 unusued
bytes.   Thus, the structure may be 13 bytes large, with 3 filler
bytes, used for <i>padding</i>.   
</p><p>
    To see this in action, try declaring a structure or class
as above, then use the <b>sizeof</b> operator, and see how
many bytes it has.
</p><p>
   Byte quantities can be stored at any address in memory.  Halfword
quantities (16 bits) are often stored at half-word aligned addresses
(addresses divisible by 2).  Doubleword quantities (64 bits) are often
stored at double-word aligned addresses (addresses divisible by 8).
You see these restrictions most often on a RISC ISA.
</p><p>
  CISC ISAs may not necessarily require alignment of words, etc.
